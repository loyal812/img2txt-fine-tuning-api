In addition, instead of directly\nimitating the selected motion, users can gradually imitate\nintermediate human poses using a motion manipulator. Fur-\nthermore, we visualized the attention maps along with the\nself-attention module to demonstrate the importance of each\nbody part (Figure 10). This may be a clue for discovering\nbody parts that should be focused on and what can be ignored.\nTo go a step further, this might indicate the importance of the\nbody parts that trainees should follow to revise their poses\noptimally. In the future, we plan to conduct user studies to\nevaluate the training effectiveness of the proposed system\nand determine whether the crucial points shown by the atten-\ntion maps can be used in real training scenarios. Moreover,\nwe consider that using a high-quality motion capture sys-\ntem can enhance the solidity of the proposed system with\nhigh-precision human poses despite the high speed of motion,\nsuch as golf swings.\nAs this work focuses on proposing a novel \ufb02ow for con-\nstructing a sports analysis tool, and because user studies may\nvary from domain to domain and are \ufb02exible for the system\ndesigner, further user studies evaluating the proposed sys-\ntem\u2019s ef\ufb01ciency have not been addressed in practice. As pre-\nviously mentioned, there are many ways to design a proper\nway to provide feedback to users for training. Related works\nthat use multi-modal feedback to alert users when performing\nthe wrong way compared to professionals have shown their\nsigni\ufb01cance during training. In the future, we plan to combine\nour approach with other feedback systems and evaluate the\neffectiveness of the system. Furthermore, we plan to apply the\nproposed approach to other sports and skill training processes\nto explore the generality of the proposed method.\nVIII. CONCLUSION\nWe propose a golf swing analysis tool that uses neural net-\nworks to help users intuitively understand the difference\nbetween themselves and professional players. We divide our\nwork into three parts: synchronization, discrepancy detec-\ntion, and manipulation. First, the motion synchronizer aligns\nmotions with different phases and timings. The experi-\nment shows that our implementation using skeleton inputs\ncan achieve a better performance than state-of-the-art video\nimplementations.\nSecond, using the proposed networks, we use a motion\ndiscrepancy detector to \ufb01nd \ufb01ne-grained differences between\ngolf swings in the latent space. By applying comparative anal-\nysis, such as comparing 3D human poses in those detected\nframes, we conclude that the motion discrepancy detector can\ndistinguish whether the difference between the two motions is\nsmall or large. The proposed SA-TCC network outperforms\nthe previous TCC network in terms of phase classi\ufb01cation\naccuracy and has the best ability to show the correlation\nbetween the distance in the latent space and the MPJPE.\nThird, based on the synchronization and discrepancy detec-\ntion results, we introduce a decoder structure called a motionmanipulator to restore motion from the latent space. The\nrestoration results suggest that the network can retrieve inter-\nmediate human poses between two motions that do not\nexist in the original dataset. Furthermore, instead of teach-\ning beginners directly about professional forms, the motion\nmanipulator can provide them with an intermediate pose that\nis more acceptable for beginners to start with.\nFinally, with the above three main contributions of this\nwork, we create an application for analyzing and visualiz-\ning the discrepancy between two input golf swing motions.\nFor user interaction, users can quickly grasp the difference\nbetween their swings and those of various experts during\nself-training. In addition, by understanding the continuous\nchanges step-by-step between the two selected human poses,\nwe aim to help users ef\ufb01ciently learn an ideal form in a\ngradual manner instead of directly imitating ideal motion.\nUsing the proposed system, users can choose an ideal form\nto imitate and learn to play sports without the help of coaches\nduring self-training. We intend to re\ufb01ne the proposed pro-\ntotype application and conduct user studies to investigate its\neffectiveness.\n\npage_label: 106286\nfile_path: src\\test\\regression\\regression_test004\\AI_Golf_Golf_Swing_Analysis_Tool_for_Self-Training.pdf\n\nReceived 20 August 2022, accepted 18 September 2022, date of publication 6 October 2022, date of current version 11 October 2022.\nDigital Object Identifier 10.1 109/ACCESS.2022.3210261\nAI Golf: Golf Swing Analysis Tool for Self-Training\nCHEN-CHIEH LIAO\n1, DONG-HYUN HWANG\n2, AND HIDEKI KOIKE\n1\n1Department of Computer Science, Tokyo Institute of Technology, Tokyo 152-8550, Japan\n2NAVER CLOVA Voice&Avatar, Seongnam 13561, South Korea\nCorresponding author: Chen-Chieh Liao (liao.c.aa@m.titech.ac.jp)\nThis work was supported by the Japan Science and Technology Agency (JST) Core Research for Evolutional Science and Technology\n(CREST), Japan, under Grant JPMJCR17A3.\nABSTRACT In the \ufb01eld of the acquisition of sports skills, a common way to improve sports skills, such as\ngolf swings, is to imitate professional players\u2019 motions. However, it is dif\ufb01cult for beginners to specify\nthe keyframes on which they should focus and which part of the body they should correct because of\ninconsistent timing and lack of knowledge. In this study, a golf swing analysis tool using neural networks\nis proposed to address this gap. The proposed system compares two motion sequences and speci\ufb01es\nkeyframes in which signi\ufb01cant differences can be observed between the two motions. In addition, the system\nhelps users intuitively understand the differences between themselves and professional players by using\ninterpretable clues. The main challenge of this study is to target the \ufb01ne-grained differences between users\nand professionals that can be used for self-training. Moreover, the signi\ufb01cance of the proposed approach is\nthe use of an unsupervised learning method without prior knowledge and labeled data, which will bene\ufb01t\nfuture applications and research in other sports and skill training processes. In our approach, neural networks\nare \ufb01rst used to create a motion synchronizer to align motions with different phases and timing. Next,\na motion discrepancy detector is implemented to \ufb01nd \ufb01ne-grained differences between motions in latent\nspaces that are learned by the networks. Furthermore, we consider that learning intermediate motions may\nbe feasible for beginners because, in this way, they can gradually change their pose to match the ideal form.\nTherefore, based on the synchronization and discrepancy detection results, we utilize a decoder to restore\nthe intermediate human poses between two motions from the latent space. Finally, we suggest possible\napplications for analyzing and visualizing the discrepancy between the two input motions and interacting\nwith the users.

For example, as shown in\nFigure 5, a key event in golf may be the moment when the golf\nclub hits the ball (impact), and the motion before the golf club\nhits the ball can be considered as the phase of the golf club\napproaching the ball (swinging down). Note that all the\nframes in the period between two key events have the same\nphase label. Following the key event annotation of GolfDB,\nwe labeled our pseudo dataset with eight key events: address,\ntoe-up, mid-backswing, top, mid-downswing, impact, mid-\nfollow-through, and \ufb01nish. Phases were labeled between\nevery two key events, for a total of seven phases.\nThe phase classi\ufb01cation accuracy was per frame phase\nclassi\ufb01cation. To calculate the accuracy, we \ufb01rst used the\nencoders of our TCC networks to extract latent vectors.\nWe then trained a simple classi\ufb01er on the latent vectors to\npredict the labeled phases. The classi\ufb01er was trained under\nseveral conditions by changing the percentage of the given\nlabeled data. After the classi\ufb01er was trained, we used all\nlabeled data to calculate the phase classi\ufb01cation accuracy.\nIn general, the larger the size of the given labeled data, the\nhigher the accuracy of the classi\ufb01er.\nTo explore more speci\ufb01cally the effectiveness of the net-\nwork in detecting discrepant motion, we investigated whether\nthe distance in the latent space could represent the discrep-\nancy between two input sequences by computing Pearson\u2019s\ncorrelation coef\ufb01cient. Because 3D poses varied for differ-\nent camera views, we could not directly compare the two\nhuman poses using the results from the 3d pose estimator.\nThus, we applied Procrustes analysis to align the two human\nposes to ensure that they were seen from the same camera\ndirection.

CASE STUDY\nIn our early study, we conducted a qualitative analysis by\nexploring the latent space to investigate whether the network\ncould trace \ufb01ne-grained differences. We \ufb01rst used the V-TCC\nto synchronize the swing motions of professionals and begin-\nners. We then computed the distances between the aligned\nvideos in the latent space and visualized the overlaid 3D\nhuman poses for qualitative comparison (Figure 6).TABLE 1.

CASE STUDY\nIn our early case study, we observed that in most cases, when\nthe distance in the latent space was small, the difference\nbetween the two 3D poses was small(Figure 6c). On the\nother hand, when the distance was considerable, the 3D poses\nshowed more differences(Figure 6b, d). This suggested that\nthe network could distinguish between beginners and profes-\nsionals. Thus, we can use this feature to retrieve motion fea-\ntures that help users target the key moves they have to correct.\nHowever, as depicted in Figure 6(a), the distance in the latent\nspace remained large even in certain circumstances where the\nVOLUME 10, 2022 106291\n\npage_label: 106292\nfile_path: src\\test\\regression\\regression_test004\\AI_Golf_Golf_Swing_Analysis_Tool_for_Self-Training.pdf\n\nC.-C.

The red line in the\ngraph indicates the threshold for discrepancy detection. The colored skeleton and black skeleton indicate the user\u2019s pose and expert\u2019s pose,\nrespectively. The density and radius of red spheres indicate the degree of joint position difference between the two skeletons.\nFIGURE 7. Pearson\u2019s correlation test for V-TCC. Left: normal videos. Right:\nvideos without background.\nFIGURE 8. Pearson\u2019s correlation test with skeleton input. Left: S-TCC.\nRight: SA-TCC.\njoint difference was negligible. This might be explained by\nthe fact that the network focused not only on human motion\nbut also on other motion features. In this case, the golf club\u2019s\nmovement, which was also critical during the swing, might\nbe the main factor causing the enormous distance in the latent\nspace. This led us to the following quantitative studies, where\nwe conducted statistical tests to examine the accuracy of the\nsynchronization and the correlation between the latent space\nand joint difference under various conditions.\nB. PHASE CLASSIFICATION ACCURACY\nIn this quantitative study, we discovered that the previous\nTCC implementation had limited precision in terms of syn-\nchronization. As our hypothesis suggests, synchronization\nquality might be in\ufb02uenced by various background informa-\ntion and other movements, such as the golf club\u2019s and human\nshadow\u2019s motions. When the background was removed, a sig-\nni\ufb01cant increase in the accuracy of the V-TCC model was\nobserved. This result supported our hypothesis that infor-\nmation outside the human region would affect alignment.Various types of information from the background, the\nmovement of human shadows, and the motion of properties\ncontrolled by a human might be learned as features by the net-\nwork, thus affecting the accuracy of the analysis. Because of\nthe signi\ufb01cant superiority of the without-background version,\nwe considered it necessary to apply background subtraction\nbefore synchronization when building applications for real\nusage.\nNext, considering the skeleton version, both S-TCC and\nSA-TCC outperformed V-TCC under all conditions. Given\nonly 10% of the labeled data, both S-TCC and SA-TCC\nachieved a phase classi\ufb01cation accuracy of over 90%. This\nmight be explained by the fact that the skeleton version\nhad more compressed and precise information than the\nvideo version, where the color information might be noisy.\nAdditionally, 3D poses represented high-level human fea-\ntures. Therefore, the features outside the human region were\nremoved when retrieving 3D human poses, resulting in more\nprecise accuracy for further golf swing analysis. Note that the\nskeleton data were the estimated results from the video data,\nand the estimation could not be perfect for every human pose.\nDespite imperfect skeleton inputs, the S-TCC and SA-TCC\nnetworks outperformed V-TCC. This result suggested that we\ncould use the skeleton version for more precise implementa-\ntion in actual usage.\nFinally, comparing the two skeleton version mod-\nels, S-TCC performed better than SA-TCC under most\nconditions. However, SA-TCC remained competitive in some\ncircumstances (better than S-TCC with 10% labeled data).\nThis led to the following correlation test, in which we dis-\ncussed the ability of the networks to detect discrepancies\nbetween two motions.\nC. CORRELATION\nDiscussing the correlation test, as shown in Figure 7,\nwe observed a correlation between the distance in the latent\nspace and the MPJPE. While the distribution of the data pairs\nseemed to be scattered, a Pearson\u2019s correlation coef\ufb01cient of\nover 0.69 showed the potential of the network to distinguish\nwhether the difference between the two motions was small\nor large.

Liao et al.: AI Golf: Golf Swing Analysis Tool for Self-Training\nindividuals, we must align the motions to make them com-\nparable. A conventional method for aligning two temporal\nsequences is dynamic time warping (DTW), which was intro-\nduced by Berndt and Clifford [18]. In this method, every\nindex in a sequence is matched with one or more indices from\nanother sequence, and the mapping of the indices from the\n\ufb01rst sequence to the other sequences must be monotonically\nincreasing. The DTW concept has been introduced in several\ndomains. For example, Ikeda et al. [19] proposed a real-time\ngolf swing projecting system that simultaneously visualized\nprofessional and user forms with matched timing. To align\nthe two motions in real-time, they measured the DTW only\nover a short period and penalized the previous cost value at\na later time. Halperin et al. [20] utilized the concept of DTW\nin speech and presented an audio-to-video alignment method\nfor matching speech-to-lip movements.\nOn the other hand, self-supervised neural networks have\nrecently been developed to tackle video alignment tasks\nusing the latent space representation [12], [21], [22]. In this\napproach, an embedder is used to compress input videos\ninto a latent space. After the embedding process, a loss is\ndesigned to \ufb01nd correspondences through time in the latent\nspace, thus encouraging the network to learn a latent space\nwhere similar motions should appear to be close. This method\nhelps synchronize high complexity temporal sequences, such\nas videos. In this study, we base the loss of our network on the\ntemporal cycle-consistency loss used by Dwibedi et al. [12],\nbut apply DTW along with the loss for smooth temporal\nmatching.\nC. DISCREPANCY DETECTION\nBy comparing the two synchronized motions, we can deter-\nmine the difference between them in terms of human pos-\ntures. In early studies, abnormal detection referred mainly\nto \ufb01nding patterns in data that did not match the expected\nbehavior [25]. Recently, two methods have been proposed for\ndetecting abnormalities In the \ufb01rst approach, abnormal infor-\nmation is referred to as prior knowledge. For example, Parra-\nDominguez et al. [26] trained a binary classi\ufb01er on annotated\ndata to determine whether abnormal events occurred during\na stair descent. In the second approach to abnormal detec-\ntion, abnormal information is not provided in advance. The\nresearch group of Nater et al. [27] proposed an unsupervised\nlearning method for learning normal human behavior. They\nused a hierarchical representation of the appearance and\naction level of regular movements to detect abnormal events.\nWhile a network may be trained to detect abnormal events,\nsuch as falling to the ground, we focus on whether a neural\nnetwork can be trained to automatically detect \ufb01ne-grained\ndifferences between two regular motions. We call this detec-\ntion of the \ufb01ne-grained difference discrepancy detection. The\nmost relevant of these studies is that of Abati et al. [28]. They\ndesigned a deep autoencoder with a parametric estimator\nthat learned a probability distribution from the latent space\nto detect discrepancies. The encoder effectively remembered\nstandard samples and could distinguish between normal and\nFIGURE 1. System overview. Xis the input motion sequence and Yis the\noutput human poses restored from the latent space.\nabnormal images. However, although the network could eas-\nily detect surprise samples, \ufb01ne-grained differences among\nstandard samples were not discussed. In addition to image-\nbased methods, recent studies have focused on systems that\nuse 3D human pose information [29], [30]. In this study,\nwe apply discrepancy detection to both videos and 3D\nhuman poses and discuss the ability of the system to detect\n\ufb01ne-grained differences between two input motions.\nIII.

RELATED WORK\nA. SPORTS TRAINING FOR SKILL ACQUISITION\nMany recent studies have focused on developing sports\ntraining systems to help beginners improve their skills. Stud-\nies [13], [14], [15] have proposed multi-modal sports training\nsystems based on sports theories. In their system, users\nreceived visual, haptic, and audio feedback when they did not\nideally move their bodies or instruments. However, the ideal\nmovement could differ from sport to sport, meaning that it\nmay be dif\ufb01cult to generalize these methodologies to other\nsports.\nOn the other hand, another way to learn sports skills is\nimitating professional players\u2019 motions [1], [3], [4], [5].\nIkeda et al. [16] proposed a golf swing training system that\nuses the motions of professional golfers. In their system,\na user\u2019s motion was synchronized with a selected ideal\nprofessional\u2019s motion, and the two motions were overlaid and\nprojected onto the ground during training. Sasaki et al. [17]\nalso reported the importance of beginners copying expert\nmotions and proposed a climbing training system using pose\nprediction. Their system predicted and visualized the pose of\nexperts based on the user\u2019s current hand and foot positions.\nWhile these recent studies have shown the effectiveness of\nusing multi-modal feedback and the potential of applying\nneural networks to create AI teachers for sports training, it is\ndif\ufb01cult for users to change their motion forms immediately\nto match ideal forms. Thus, building a system that can teach\nusers step-by-step to improve their sports skills remains\nchallenging.\nB.

However, it is dif\ufb01cult for beginners to specify\nthe keyframes on which they should focus and which part of the body they should correct because of\ninconsistent timing and lack of knowledge. In this study, a golf swing analysis tool using neural networks\nis proposed to address this gap. The proposed system compares two motion sequences and speci\ufb01es\nkeyframes in which signi\ufb01cant differences can be observed between the two motions. In addition, the system\nhelps users intuitively understand the differences between themselves and professional players by using\ninterpretable clues. The main challenge of this study is to target the \ufb01ne-grained differences between users\nand professionals that can be used for self-training. Moreover, the signi\ufb01cance of the proposed approach is\nthe use of an unsupervised learning method without prior knowledge and labeled data, which will bene\ufb01t\nfuture applications and research in other sports and skill training processes. In our approach, neural networks\nare \ufb01rst used to create a motion synchronizer to align motions with different phases and timing. Next,\na motion discrepancy detector is implemented to \ufb01nd \ufb01ne-grained differences between motions in latent\nspaces that are learned by the networks. Furthermore, we consider that learning intermediate motions may\nbe feasible for beginners because, in this way, they can gradually change their pose to match the ideal form.\nTherefore, based on the synchronization and discrepancy detection results, we utilize a decoder to restore\nthe intermediate human poses between two motions from the latent space. Finally, we suggest possible\napplications for analyzing and visualizing the discrepancy between the two input motions and interacting\nwith the users. With the proposed application, users can easily understand the differences between their\nmotions and those of various experts during self-training and learn how to improve their motions.\nINDEX TERMS Computer vision, machine learning, motor skill training, golf.\nI. INTRODUCTION\nIn sports, it is dif\ufb01cult for beginners to improve their skills\nwithout prior knowledge or assistance from coaches. As a\nconventional method, people go to lessons to meet experts\nand learn how to play in the proper form. However, in most\nsports, players spend considerable time training alone to\nachieve outstanding results in the \ufb01eld and retain exceptional\nbody conditions. Therefore, it is important to design and\nimplement an effective and accurate self-training process for\nsuch situations.\nIn the \ufb01eld of the acquisition of sports skills, one way\nto improve sports skills is to replicate professional players\u2019\nmotions. People watch the movements of professional ath-\nThe associate editor coordinating the review of this manuscript and\napproving it for publication was Jinjia Zhou\n .letes on television or the Internet and try to make their bodies\nmove similarly to professionals. To accelerate this process,\nmany systems have recently been developed to help users\nunderstand the movements of professionals [1], [2], [3], [4],\n[5]. However, in these previous works and systems, users may\nstruggle to re\ufb01ne their movement with no idea which timing\nof the whole motion, which parts of the body they should\nfocus on, or how they can change their body movements to\nget their form closer to that of professionals.\nWith signi\ufb01cant advances in machine learning technolo-\ngies, many systems have been built to recognize differ-\nent objects, make predictions for decisions, or even predict\nthe future [6].\n\npage_label: 106294\nfile_path: src\\test\\regression\\regression_test004\\AI_Golf_Golf_Swing_Analysis_Tool_for_Self-Training.pdf\n\nC.-C.

In addition, instead of directly\nimitating the selected motion, users can gradually imitate\nintermediate human poses using a motion manipulator. Fur-\nthermore, we visualized the attention maps along with the\nself-attention module to demonstrate the importance of each\nbody part (Figure 10). This may be a clue for discovering\nbody parts that should be focused on and what can be ignored.\nTo go a step further, this might indicate the importance of the\nbody parts that trainees should follow to revise their poses\noptimally. In the future, we plan to conduct user studies to\nevaluate the training effectiveness of the proposed system\nand determine whether the crucial points shown by the atten-\ntion maps can be used in real training scenarios. Moreover,\nwe consider that using a high-quality motion capture sys-\ntem can enhance the solidity of the proposed system with\nhigh-precision human poses despite the high speed of motion,\nsuch as golf swings.\nAs this work focuses on proposing a novel \ufb02ow for con-\nstructing a sports analysis tool, and because user studies may\nvary from domain to domain and are \ufb02exible for the system\ndesigner, further user studies evaluating the proposed sys-\ntem\u2019s ef\ufb01ciency have not been addressed in practice.

By applying comparative anal-\nysis, such as comparing 3D human poses in those detected\nframes, we conclude that the motion discrepancy detector can\ndistinguish whether the difference between the two motions is\nsmall or large. The proposed SA-TCC network outperforms\nthe previous TCC network in terms of phase classi\ufb01cation\naccuracy and has the best ability to show the correlation\nbetween the distance in the latent space and the MPJPE.\nThird, based on the synchronization and discrepancy detec-\ntion results, we introduce a decoder structure called a motionmanipulator to restore motion from the latent space. The\nrestoration results suggest that the network can retrieve inter-\nmediate human poses between two motions that do not\nexist in the original dataset. Furthermore, instead of teach-\ning beginners directly about professional forms, the motion\nmanipulator can provide them with an intermediate pose that\nis more acceptable for beginners to start with.\nFinally, with the above three main contributions of this\nwork, we create an application for analyzing and visualiz-\ning the discrepancy between two input golf swing motions.\nFor user interaction, users can quickly grasp the difference\nbetween their swings and those of various experts during\nself-training. In addition, by understanding the continuous\nchanges step-by-step between the two selected human poses,\nwe aim to help users ef\ufb01ciently learn an ideal form in a\ngradual manner instead of directly imitating ideal motion.\nUsing the proposed system, users can choose an ideal form\nto imitate and learn to play sports without the help of coaches\nduring self-training. We intend to re\ufb01ne the proposed pro-\ntotype application and conduct user studies to investigate its\neffectiveness.\nQuery: Question: What is the main purpose of the proposed AI Golf Swing Analysis Tool for Self-Training?\nOriginal Answer: The main purpose of the proposed AI Golf Swing Analysis Tool for Self-Training is to help users intuitively understand the differences between their golf swing and that of professional players. The system uses neural networks to analyze golf swings, identify keyframes where significant differences can be observed, and provide interpretable clues to users. It aims to target the fine-grained differences between users and professionals that can be used for self-training. The system also includes a user interface where users can select any professional's form from a database, compare it with their own, and gradually imitate intermediate human poses. The tool is designed to assist users in improving their golf swings during self-training.\nNew Answer: "}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The primary goal of the proposed AI Golf Swing Analysis Tool for Self-Training is to enable users to effectively comprehend the discrepancies between their golf swings and those of expert players.

RELATED WORK\nA. SPORTS TRAINING FOR SKILL ACQUISITION\nMany recent studies have focused on developing sports\ntraining systems to help beginners improve their skills. Stud-\nies [13], [14], [15] have proposed multi-modal sports training\nsystems based on sports theories. In their system, users\nreceived visual, haptic, and audio feedback when they did not\nideally move their bodies or instruments. However, the ideal\nmovement could differ from sport to sport, meaning that it\nmay be dif\ufb01cult to generalize these methodologies to other\nsports.\nOn the other hand, another way to learn sports skills is\nimitating professional players\u2019 motions [1], [3], [4], [5].\nIkeda et al. [16] proposed a golf swing training system that\nuses the motions of professional golfers. In their system,\na user\u2019s motion was synchronized with a selected ideal\nprofessional\u2019s motion, and the two motions were overlaid and\nprojected onto the ground during training. Sasaki et al. [17]\nalso reported the importance of beginners copying expert\nmotions and proposed a climbing training system using pose\nprediction. Their system predicted and visualized the pose of\nexperts based on the user\u2019s current hand and foot positions.\nWhile these recent studies have shown the effectiveness of\nusing multi-modal feedback and the potential of applying\nneural networks to create AI teachers for sports training, it is\ndif\ufb01cult for users to change their motion forms immediately\nto match ideal forms. Thus, building a system that can teach\nusers step-by-step to improve their sports skills remains\nchallenging.\nB. VIDEO AND MOTION ALIGNMENT\nAn ef\ufb01cient way to evaluate whether a person is performing\na motion correctly is to compare their motion with oth-\ners whose motion is considered correct.

Liao et al.: AI Golf: Golf Swing Analysis Tool for Self-Training\nFIGURE 6. Case study with the V-TCC. The line graph shows the distance between two synchronized motions in the latent space. The red line in the\ngraph indicates the threshold for discrepancy detection. The colored skeleton and black skeleton indicate the user\u2019s pose and expert\u2019s pose,\nrespectively.

Right:\nvideos without background.\nFIGURE 8. Pearson\u2019s correlation test with skeleton input. Left: S-TCC.\nRight: SA-TCC.\njoint difference was negligible. This might be explained by\nthe fact that the network focused not only on human motion\nbut also on other motion features. In this case, the golf club\u2019s\nmovement, which was also critical during the swing, might\nbe the main factor causing the enormous distance in the latent\nspace. This led us to the following quantitative studies, where\nwe conducted statistical tests to examine the accuracy of the\nsynchronization and the correlation between the latent space\nand joint difference under various conditions.\nB. PHASE CLASSIFICATION ACCURACY\nIn this quantitative study, we discovered that the previous\nTCC implementation had limited precision in terms of syn-\nchronization. As our hypothesis suggests, synchronization\nquality might be in\ufb02uenced by various background informa-\ntion and other movements, such as the golf club\u2019s and human\nshadow\u2019s motions. When the background was removed, a sig-\nni\ufb01cant increase in the accuracy of the V-TCC model was\nobserved. This result supported our hypothesis that infor-\nmation outside the human region would affect alignment.Various types of information from the background, the\nmovement of human shadows, and the motion of properties\ncontrolled by a human might be learned as features by the net-\nwork, thus affecting the accuracy of the analysis. Because of\nthe signi\ufb01cant superiority of the without-background version,\nwe considered it necessary to apply background subtraction\nbefore synchronization when building applications for real\nusage.\nNext, considering the skeleton version, both S-TCC and\nSA-TCC outperformed V-TCC under all conditions. Given\nonly 10% of the labeled data, both S-TCC and SA-TCC\nachieved a phase classi\ufb01cation accuracy of over 90%. This\nmight be explained by the fact that the skeleton version\nhad more compressed and precise information than the\nvideo version, where the color information might be noisy.\nAdditionally, 3D poses represented high-level human fea-\ntures. Therefore, the features outside the human region were\nremoved when retrieving 3D human poses, resulting in more\nprecise accuracy for further golf swing analysis. Note that the\nskeleton data were the estimated results from the video data,\nand the estimation could not be perfect for every human pose.\nDespite imperfect skeleton inputs, the S-TCC and SA-TCC\nnetworks outperformed V-TCC. This result suggested that we\ncould use the skeleton version for more precise implementa-\ntion in actual usage.\nFinally, comparing the two skeleton version mod-\nels, S-TCC performed better than SA-TCC under most\nconditions. However, SA-TCC remained competitive in some\ncircumstances (better than S-TCC with 10% labeled data).\nThis led to the following correlation test, in which we dis-\ncussed the ability of the networks to detect discrepancies\nbetween two motions.\nC. CORRELATION\nDiscussing the correlation test, as shown in Figure 7,\nwe observed a correlation between the distance in the latent\nspace and the MPJPE. While the distribution of the data pairs\nseemed to be scattered, a Pearson\u2019s correlation coef\ufb01cient of\nover 0.69 showed the potential of the network to distinguish\nwhether the difference between the two motions was small\nor large. However, as discussed in the case study section,\nin some circumstances, the network failed to detect discrepant\n106292 VOLUME 10, 2022\n\nfile_path: src\\test\\regression\\regression_test004\\train_questions.txt\n\nWhat was the motion manipulation technique used in the AI Golf swing analysis tool?\nWhat is the phase classification accuracy metric used to evaluate the network's ability to classify motion frames to their corresponding phases?\nWhat is the Pearson's correlation coefficient for skeleton inputs using the S-TCC model?\nQuestion: What method is used in this study to align two temporal sequences?\nWhat is the purpose of the proposed system in this study?\nWhat are the three main contributions of the proposed golf swing analysis tool?\nQuestion: What is the main purpose of the proposed AI Golf Swing Analysis Tool for Self-Training?\nQuestion: What is the title of the paper mentioned in the context that applies pose estimation to predict amateur golf swing performance?\nWhat is the title of the paper mentioned in the context?\nQuestion: What is the title of the paper mentioned in the context information?\nQuestion: What is the title of the paper referenced in citation [28]?\nQuestion: Who received the B.S. degree from the School of Computer Science and Engineering, Korea University of Technology and Education, Cheonan, South Korea, in 2017?\nWhat is the correlation between the distance in the latent space and the MPJPE in the golf swing analysis tool?\n---------------------\nGiven the context information and not prior knowledge, answer the query.\nQuery: What is the correlation between the distance in the latent space and the MPJPE in the golf swing analysis tool?\nAnswer: "}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The correlation between the distance in the latent space and the MPJPE in the golf swing analysis tool is over 0.69, as indicated by the Pearson's correlation coefficient."}]}
