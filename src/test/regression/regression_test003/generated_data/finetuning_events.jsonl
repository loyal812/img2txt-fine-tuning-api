However, it is dif\ufb01cult for beginners to specify\nthe keyframes on which they should focus and which part of the body they should correct because of\ninconsistent timing and lack of knowledge. In this study, a golf swing analysis tool using neural networks\nis proposed to address this gap. The proposed system compares two motion sequences and speci\ufb01es\nkeyframes in which signi\ufb01cant differences can be observed between the two motions. In addition, the system\nhelps users intuitively understand the differences between themselves and professional players by using\ninterpretable clues. The main challenge of this study is to target the \ufb01ne-grained differences between users\nand professionals that can be used for self-training. Moreover, the signi\ufb01cance of the proposed approach is\nthe use of an unsupervised learning method without prior knowledge and labeled data, which will bene\ufb01t\nfuture applications and research in other sports and skill training processes. In our approach, neural networks\nare \ufb01rst used to create a motion synchronizer to align motions with different phases and timing. Next,\na motion discrepancy detector is implemented to \ufb01nd \ufb01ne-grained differences between motions in latent\nspaces that are learned by the networks. Furthermore, we consider that learning intermediate motions may\nbe feasible for beginners because, in this way, they can gradually change their pose to match the ideal form.\nTherefore, based on the synchronization and discrepancy detection results, we utilize a decoder to restore\nthe intermediate human poses between two motions from the latent space. Finally, we suggest possible\napplications for analyzing and visualizing the discrepancy between the two input motions and interacting\nwith the users. With the proposed application, users can easily understand the differences between their\nmotions and those of various experts during self-training and learn how to improve their motions.\nINDEX TERMS Computer vision, machine learning, motor skill training, golf.\nI.

However, in most\nsports, players spend considerable time training alone to\nachieve outstanding results in the \ufb01eld and retain exceptional\nbody conditions. Therefore, it is important to design and\nimplement an effective and accurate self-training process for\nsuch situations.\nIn the \ufb01eld of the acquisition of sports skills, one way\nto improve sports skills is to replicate professional players\u2019\nmotions.

To accelerate this process,\nmany systems have recently been developed to help users\nunderstand the movements of professionals [1], [2], [3], [4],\n[5]. However, in these previous works and systems, users may\nstruggle to re\ufb01ne their movement with no idea which timing\nof the whole motion, which parts of the body they should\nfocus on, or how they can change their body movements to\nget their form closer to that of professionals.\nWith signi\ufb01cant advances in machine learning technolo-\ngies, many systems have been built to recognize differ-\nent objects, make predictions for decisions, or even predict\nthe future [6].\nQuery: What was the motion manipulation technique used in the AI Golf swing analysis tool?\nOriginal Answer: The motion manipulation technique used in the AI Golf swing analysis tool involves a decoder structure called a motion manipulator.

Liao et al.: AI Golf: Golf Swing Analysis Tool for Self-Training\nFIGURE 4. Three types of datasets.\nC. MOTION MANIPULATOR: DISCOVERING\nINTERMEDIATE MOTION BETWEEN HUMAN POSES\nDuring self-training, it is not always simple for beginners\nto imitate an ideal motion form, which is very different\nfrom their current form. In this study, we propose a motion\ndecoder to generate an intermediate motion. As mentioned\npreviously, the TCC network is trained to learn a latent space\nthat shows motion similarity. Therefore, we understand that\na high-dimensional data point in latent space can be rep-\nresentative of a human pose. To retrieve the intermediate\nmotion between two points in the latent space, we train a\ndecoder using latent vectors to predict human poses that\nare the same as the inputs. In particular, we \ufb01rst input the\ntraining set data into the trained TCC network to obtain the\noutputs of the latent vectors. Next, using the latent vectors\nas inputs, we trained a simple decoder consisting of a single\nfully-connected layer to produce the outputs of the human\nposes. For the loss function LMSE, we take the mean square\nerror (MSE) between the output and input poses:\nLMSE=\u2211\ni||Yi\u2212Xi||2(4)\nwhere Xiis the ithjoint of the input human pose XandYiis\ntheithjoint of the output human pose Y.\nAfter training the motion decoder, we retrieve a new latent\nvector Vinterbetween the two timing-matched latent vectors\nusing linear interpolation:\nVinter=(1\u2212\u03b1)\u00d7V1+\u03b1\u00d7V2 (5)\nwhere V1andV2are the two latent vectors synchronized by\nthe motion synchronizer, and \u03b1\u22080.0,1.0 is the magnitude\nparameter. In the above formulation, by increasing the value\nof\u03b1, we can obtain a human pose whose latent vector is closer\ntoV2, and the restored human pose should ideally be more\nsimilar to the human poses generated from V2.\nIV. EXPERIMENTAL SETUP\nTo evaluate the accuracy and effectiveness of the three mod-\nules introduced in the previous section, we collected golf\nswing data via the Internet and created a pseudo database\nconsisting of raw video data, without-background-video data,\nand 3D pose data (Figure 4). Next, we implemented three\nmodels of the network (V-TCC, S-TCC, and SA-TCC) uti-\nlizing TCC loss and conducted statistical analysis under four\ndifferent conditions:\n\u2022V-TCC using video inputs with backgrounds\nFIGURE 5.

VIDEO DATASET\nAs the training dataset, we used GolfDB [33], a video dataset\ncollection for all types of golf iron swings and driver swings,\nconsisting of 1400 high-quality golf swing videos of male and\nfemale professional golfers. Although the GolfDB provided\npreprocessed video clips for a frame size of 160 \u00d7160,\nwe rebuilt our pseudo dataset with high-resolution videos.\nIn addition to clean videos, we created another video dataset\nwithout background information. This was because, in our\nhypothesis, the background information, for example, the\nhuman shadow, might in\ufb02uence the alignment of the network.\nMoreover, the network might also learn the motion of props,\nsuch as golf clubs. We used Mask R-CNN [34], a generic\nobject detection and segmentation network, to detect the\nhuman body in a single image frame. We then removed the\nbackground pixels and left only the human body (Figure 4).\nB. 3D POSE DATASET\nTo conduct a more precise analysis of only human poses,\nwe created a new pseudo dataset consisting of 3D point\ndata of human body poses. In this dataset, we \ufb01rst used\nHRNet [35] to retrieve the time series of 2D human poses\nfrom golf-swing videos.\n\npage_label: 106294\nfile_path: src\\test\\regression\\regression_test004\\AI_Golf_Golf_Swing_Analysis_Tool_for_Self-Training.pdf\n\nC.-C.

RELATED WORK\nA. SPORTS TRAINING FOR SKILL ACQUISITION\nMany recent studies have focused on developing sports\ntraining systems to help beginners improve their skills. Stud-\nies [13], [14], [15] have proposed multi-modal sports training\nsystems based on sports theories. In their system, users\nreceived visual, haptic, and audio feedback when they did not\nideally move their bodies or instruments. However, the ideal\nmovement could differ from sport to sport, meaning that it\nmay be dif\ufb01cult to generalize these methodologies to other\nsports.\nOn the other hand, another way to learn sports skills is\nimitating professional players\u2019 motions [1], [3], [4], [5].\nIkeda et al. [16] proposed a golf swing training system that\nuses the motions of professional golfers. In their system,\na user\u2019s motion was synchronized with a selected ideal\nprofessional\u2019s motion, and the two motions were overlaid and\nprojected onto the ground during training. Sasaki et al. [17]\nalso reported the importance of beginners copying expert\nmotions and proposed a climbing training system using pose\nprediction. Their system predicted and visualized the pose of\nexperts based on the user\u2019s current hand and foot positions.\nWhile these recent studies have shown the effectiveness of\nusing multi-modal feedback and the potential of applying\nneural networks to create AI teachers for sports training, it is\ndif\ufb01cult for users to change their motion forms immediately\nto match ideal forms. Thus, building a system that can teach\nusers step-by-step to improve their sports skills remains\nchallenging.\nB.

RELATED WORK\nA. SPORTS TRAINING FOR SKILL ACQUISITION\nMany recent studies have focused on developing sports\ntraining systems to help beginners improve their skills. Stud-\nies [13], [14], [15] have proposed multi-modal sports training\nsystems based on sports theories. In their system, users\nreceived visual, haptic, and audio feedback when they did not\nideally move their bodies or instruments. However, the ideal\nmovement could differ from sport to sport, meaning that it\nmay be dif\ufb01cult to generalize these methodologies to other\nsports.\nOn the other hand, another way to learn sports skills is\nimitating professional players\u2019 motions [1], [3], [4], [5].\nIkeda et al. [16] proposed a golf swing training system that\nuses the motions of professional golfers. In their system,\na user\u2019s motion was synchronized with a selected ideal\nprofessional\u2019s motion, and the two motions were overlaid and\nprojected onto the ground during training. Sasaki et al. [17]\nalso reported the importance of beginners copying expert\nmotions and proposed a climbing training system using pose\nprediction. Their system predicted and visualized the pose of\nexperts based on the user\u2019s current hand and foot positions.\nWhile these recent studies have shown the effectiveness of\nusing multi-modal feedback and the potential of applying\nneural networks to create AI teachers for sports training, it is\ndif\ufb01cult for users to change their motion forms immediately\nto match ideal forms. Thus, building a system that can teach\nusers step-by-step to improve their sports skills remains\nchallenging.\nB.

To accelerate this process,\nmany systems have recently been developed to help users\nunderstand the movements of professionals [1], [2], [3], [4],\n[5]. However, in these previous works and systems, users may\nstruggle to re\ufb01ne their movement with no idea which timing\nof the whole motion, which parts of the body they should\nfocus on, or how they can change their body movements to\nget their form closer to that of professionals.\nWith signi\ufb01cant advances in machine learning technolo-\ngies, many systems have been built to recognize differ-\nent objects, make predictions for decisions, or even predict\nthe future [6].

However, although the network could eas-\nily detect surprise samples, \ufb01ne-grained differences among\nstandard samples were not discussed. In addition to image-\nbased methods, recent studies have focused on systems that\nuse 3D human pose information [29], [30]. In this study,\nwe apply discrepancy detection to both videos and 3D\nhuman poses and discuss the ability of the system to detect\n\ufb01ne-grained differences between two input motions.\nIII. METHODS\nThis study aims to create a system that captures user motions\nand provides \ufb01ne-grained feedback to improve users\u2019 forms\nby comparing their motions with those of professionals.\nTo achieve the goal of building such an application, the\nmethod proposed in this study is to \ufb01rst train a neural network\nwith professionals\u2019 motion data. After training the network,\nthe system compresses the user motions through the network\ninto a latent space and compares their motions with those of\nprofessionals in the latent space. Figure 1 shows an overview\nof the proposed system. The work\ufb02ow of the approach is\ndivided into three parts: motion synchronization, motion dis-\ncrepancy detection, and motion manipulation. The system\n\ufb01rst receives two motion inputs X1andX2and uses encoder\nEto embed the input motions into the latent space, where the\ntwo motions are represented as L1andL2. The encoder is\ntrained to learn a latent space in which similar motions appear\nto be close.\nNext, using the learned latent space, the motion synchro-\nnizer MSmatches the timing of the two motions in the\nlatent space by measuring the Euclidean distance between\nL1andL2. The motion discrepancy detector then captures\nthe two synchronized latent vectors V1andV2, measures the\ndifference between them, and passes a distance vector D12to\nthe motion manipulator MM.\nFinally, the MM integrates V1,V2, and D12to specify\nthe key frames where large differences occur and create an\nintermediate latent vector Vinter. The system uses decoder D\nto restore the intermediate human poses Yfrom Vinterfor\nusers to gradually improve their motion forms.\nA. MOTION SYNCHRONIZER: ALIGNING MOTION\nSEQUENCES WITH DIFFERENT TIMING\nFor motion synchronization, we aim to design a network\nthat learns a latent space that shows motion similarity.\nA common way to achieve this is by constructing an\nautoencoder and decoder, whose input and output are the\nsame motions. On the other hand, previous studies have\n106288 VOLUME 10, 2022\n\npage_label: 106294\nfile_path: src\\test\\regression\\regression_test004\\AI_Golf_Golf_Swing_Analysis_Tool_for_Self-Training.pdf\n\nC.-C. Liao et al.: AI Golf: Golf Swing Analysis Tool for Self-Training\nuser interface where users can select any professional\u2019s form\nfrom the database and compare the difference between their\nforms and the professional\u2019s. In addition, instead of directly\nimitating the selected motion, users can gradually imitate\nintermediate human poses using a motion manipulator. Fur-\nthermore, we visualized the attention maps along with the\nself-attention module to demonstrate the importance of each\nbody part (Figure 10). This may be a clue for discovering\nbody parts that should be focused on and what can be ignored.\nTo go a step further, this might indicate the importance of the\nbody parts that trainees should follow to revise their poses\noptimally. In the future, we plan to conduct user studies to\nevaluate the training effectiveness of the proposed system\nand determine whether the crucial points shown by the atten-\ntion maps can be used in real training scenarios. Moreover,\nwe consider that using a high-quality motion capture sys-\ntem can enhance the solidity of the proposed system with\nhigh-precision human poses despite the high speed of motion,\nsuch as golf swings.\nAs this work focuses on proposing a novel \ufb02ow for con-\nstructing a sports analysis tool, and because user studies may\nvary from domain to domain and are \ufb02exible for the system\ndesigner, further user studies evaluating the proposed sys-\ntem\u2019s ef\ufb01ciency have not been addressed in practice. As pre-\nviously mentioned, there are many ways to design a proper\nway to provide feedback to users for training. Related works\nthat use multi-modal feedback to alert users when performing\nthe wrong way compared to professionals have shown their\nsigni\ufb01cance during training. In the future, we plan to combine\nour approach with other feedback systems and evaluate the\neffectiveness of the system. Furthermore, we plan to apply the\nproposed approach to other sports and skill training processes\nto explore the generality of the proposed method.\nVIII. CONCLUSION\nWe propose a golf swing analysis tool that uses neural net-\nworks to help users intuitively understand the difference\nbetween themselves and professional players. We divide our\nwork into three parts: synchronization, discrepancy detec-\ntion, and manipulation. First, the motion synchronizer aligns\nmotions with different phases and timings. The experi-\nment shows that our implementation using skeleton inputs\ncan achieve a better performance than state-of-the-art video\nimplementations.\nSecond, using the proposed networks, we use a motion\ndiscrepancy detector to \ufb01nd \ufb01ne-grained differences between\ngolf swings in the latent space. By applying comparative anal-\nysis, such as comparing 3D human poses in those detected\nframes, we conclude that the motion discrepancy detector can\ndistinguish whether the difference between the two motions is\nsmall or large. The proposed SA-TCC network outperforms\nthe previous TCC network in terms of phase classi\ufb01cation\naccuracy and has the best ability to show the correlation\nbetween the distance in the latent space and the MPJPE.\nThird, based on the synchronization and discrepancy detec-\ntion results, we introduce a decoder structure called a motionmanipulator to restore motion from the latent space. The\nrestoration results suggest that the network can retrieve inter-\nmediate human poses between two motions that do not\nexist in the original dataset. Furthermore, instead of teach-\ning beginners directly about professional forms, the motion\nmanipulator can provide them with an intermediate pose that\nis more acceptable for beginners to start with.\nFinally, with the above three main contributions of this\nwork, we create an application for analyzing and visualiz-\ning the discrepancy between two input golf swing motions.\nFor user interaction, users can quickly grasp the difference\nbetween their swings and those of various experts during\nself-training. In addition, by understanding the continuous\nchanges step-by-step between the two selected human poses,\nwe aim to help users ef\ufb01ciently learn an ideal form in a\ngradual manner instead of directly imitating ideal motion.\nUsing the proposed system, users can choose an ideal form\nto imitate and learn to play sports without the help of coaches\nduring self-training. We intend to re\ufb01ne the proposed pro-\ntotype application and conduct user studies to investigate its\neffectiveness.\n---------------------\nGiven the context information and not prior knowledge, answer the query.\nQuery: What is the purpose of the proposed system described in the context?\nAnswer: "}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The proposed system is designed to analyze golf swings using neural networks.

For example, as shown in\nFigure 5, a key event in golf may be the moment when the golf\nclub hits the ball (impact), and the motion before the golf club\nhits the ball can be considered as the phase of the golf club\napproaching the ball (swinging down). Note that all the\nframes in the period between two key events have the same\nphase label. Following the key event annotation of GolfDB,\nwe labeled our pseudo dataset with eight key events: address,\ntoe-up, mid-backswing, top, mid-downswing, impact, mid-\nfollow-through, and \ufb01nish. Phases were labeled between\nevery two key events, for a total of seven phases.\nThe phase classi\ufb01cation accuracy was per frame phase\nclassi\ufb01cation. To calculate the accuracy, we \ufb01rst used the\nencoders of our TCC networks to extract latent vectors.\nWe then trained a simple classi\ufb01er on the latent vectors to\npredict the labeled phases. The classi\ufb01er was trained under\nseveral conditions by changing the percentage of the given\nlabeled data. After the classi\ufb01er was trained, we used all\nlabeled data to calculate the phase classi\ufb01cation accuracy.\nIn general, the larger the size of the given labeled data, the\nhigher the accuracy of the classi\ufb01er.\nTo explore more speci\ufb01cally the effectiveness of the net-\nwork in detecting discrepant motion, we investigated whether\nthe distance in the latent space could represent the discrep-\nancy between two input sequences by computing Pearson\u2019s\ncorrelation coef\ufb01cient. Because 3D poses varied for differ-\nent camera views, we could not directly compare the two\nhuman poses using the results from the 3d pose estimator.\nThus, we applied Procrustes analysis to align the two human\nposes to ensure that they were seen from the same camera\ndirection. In our experiment, we compared the distance in the\nlatent space with the mean per joint point error (MPJPE) and\nmeasured the Pearson\u2019s correlation coef\ufb01cient \u03c1:\n\u03c1D,E=cov(D, E)\n\u03c3D\u03c3E(6)\nwhere covis the covariance; Dis the distance in the latent\nspace; Eis the MPJPE; and \u03c3Dand\u03c3Eare the standard\ndeviations of DandE.\nV. RESULTS\nThis chapter presents the results of an early qualitative\nanalysis investigating the potential of the proposed method\nto detect discrepant motion differences, followed by more\ndetailed results comparing different modules. Finally, the\nintermediate human poses generated by the motion manip-\nulator are visualized for qualitative studies.\nA. CASE STUDY\nIn our early study, we conducted a qualitative analysis by\nexploring the latent space to investigate whether the network\ncould trace \ufb01ne-grained differences. We \ufb01rst used the V-TCC\nto synchronize the swing motions of professionals and begin-\nners. We then computed the distances between the aligned\nvideos in the latent space and visualized the overlaid 3D\nhuman poses for qualitative comparison (Figure 6).TABLE 1.

After training the four mod-\nels, we computed the phase classi\ufb01cation accuracy for each\ntrained model by assigning 1%, 5%, 10%, 30%, and 80% of\nlabeled data.\nThe results are presented in Table 1.

CORRELATION\nWe computed Pearson\u2019s correlation coef\ufb01cient using the\nfour models. For video inputs, a 0.69 Pearson\u2019s correla-\ntion coef\ufb01cient was measured for regular video, and a\n0.72 Pearson\u2019s correlation coef\ufb01cient was obtained when the\nbackground was removed (Figure 7).\n\npage_label: 106291\nfile_path: src\\test\\regression\\regression_test004\\AI_Golf_Golf_Swing_Analysis_Tool_for_Self-Training.pdf\n\nIn contrast, S-TCC and\nSA-TCC were trained using the pseudo skeleton dataset\nwith unit vector normalization.

This might be explained by\nthe fact that the network focused not only on human motion\nbut also on other motion features. In this case, the golf club\u2019s\nmovement, which was also critical during the swing, might\nbe the main factor causing the enormous distance in the latent\nspace. This led us to the following quantitative studies, where\nwe conducted statistical tests to examine the accuracy of the\nsynchronization and the correlation between the latent space\nand joint difference under various conditions.\nB. PHASE CLASSIFICATION ACCURACY\nIn this quantitative study, we discovered that the previous\nTCC implementation had limited precision in terms of syn-\nchronization. As our hypothesis suggests, synchronization\nquality might be in\ufb02uenced by various background informa-\ntion and other movements, such as the golf club\u2019s and human\nshadow\u2019s motions. When the background was removed, a sig-\nni\ufb01cant increase in the accuracy of the V-TCC model was\nobserved. This result supported our hypothesis that infor-\nmation outside the human region would affect alignment.Various types of information from the background, the\nmovement of human shadows, and the motion of properties\ncontrolled by a human might be learned as features by the net-\nwork, thus affecting the accuracy of the analysis. Because of\nthe signi\ufb01cant superiority of the without-background version,\nwe considered it necessary to apply background subtraction\nbefore synchronization when building applications for real\nusage.\nNext, considering the skeleton version, both S-TCC and\nSA-TCC outperformed V-TCC under all conditions. Given\nonly 10% of the labeled data, both S-TCC and SA-TCC\nachieved a phase classi\ufb01cation accuracy of over 90%. This\nmight be explained by the fact that the skeleton version\nhad more compressed and precise information than the\nvideo version, where the color information might be noisy.\nAdditionally, 3D poses represented high-level human fea-\ntures. Therefore, the features outside the human region were\nremoved when retrieving 3D human poses, resulting in more\nprecise accuracy for further golf swing analysis. Note that the\nskeleton data were the estimated results from the video data,\nand the estimation could not be perfect for every human pose.\nDespite imperfect skeleton inputs, the S-TCC and SA-TCC\nnetworks outperformed V-TCC. This result suggested that we\ncould use the skeleton version for more precise implementa-\ntion in actual usage.\nFinally, comparing the two skeleton version mod-\nels, S-TCC performed better than SA-TCC under most\nconditions. However, SA-TCC remained competitive in some\ncircumstances (better than S-TCC with 10% labeled data).\nThis led to the following correlation test, in which we dis-\ncussed the ability of the networks to detect discrepancies\nbetween two motions.\nC. CORRELATION\nDiscussing the correlation test, as shown in Figure 7,\nwe observed a correlation between the distance in the latent\nspace and the MPJPE. While the distribution of the data pairs\nseemed to be scattered, a Pearson\u2019s correlation coef\ufb01cient of\nover 0.69 showed the potential of the network to distinguish\nwhether the difference between the two motions was small\nor large.
