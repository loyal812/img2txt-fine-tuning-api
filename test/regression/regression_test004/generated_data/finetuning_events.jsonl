Equations are written in the Eulerian coor-\ndinate but the derivation is easier in Lagrangian coordinate. We assume all functions are\nsmooth enough such that the differentiation and integration is interchangeable.\n1.3.1. Conservation of mass. The \ufb02uid parcel will move with the \ufb02uid \ufb02ow. Its shape\ncould change due to the distortion by the \ufb02ow while the mass of a \ufb02uid parcel remains\nconstant. This is considered as a basic principle of classical mechanics.\nLet us take an arbitrary domain \u21260in the reference coordinate and consider its defor-\nmation \u2126\u03c4at time\u03c4. The mass of the \ufb02uid inside the domain \u2126\u03c4is expressed as\nmass =\u222b\n\u2126\u03c4\u03c1(x,\u03c4) dx.\nConservation of mass implies that\nd\nd\u03c4(mass) = 0\u2212\u2192\u222b\n\u2126\u03c4D\u03c4\u03c1+\u03c1divudx=\u222b\n\u2126\u03c4\u03c1t+\u2207\u00b7(\u03c1u) dx= 0.\nSince the domain is arbitrary, we get the mass conservation (also known as continuity)\nequation\n(6) \u03c1t+\u2207\u00b7(\u03c1u) = 0.\nTo further illustrate the difference between Eulerian and Lagrangian coordinates, we\nderive (6) in Eulerian coordinate. Now take an arbitrary domain \u2126in Eulerian coordinate,\nwhich does not change in time. We consider the change of the mass in \u2126:\nd\ndt\u222b\n\u2126\u03c1(x,t)dx=\u222b\n\u2126\u2202t\u03c1(x,t)dx.\nThe change of mass is due to the fact that some \ufb02uid parcels \ufb02ow into or out of \u2126which is\ncharacterized by the surface integral of \ufb02ux\n\u2212\u222b\n\u2202\u2126\u03c1u\u00b7ndS.\nThe negative sign is chosen since nis the outwards normal direction and u\u00b7n>0means\nthe loss of mass.\nMass conservation is then described by\n\u222b\n\u2126\u2202t\u03c1(x,t)dx=\u2212\u222b\n\u2202\u2126\u03c1u\u00b7ndS.\n---------------------\nGiven the context information and not prior knowledge, answer the query.\nQuery: Question: What is the equation that represents the conservation of mass in fluid dynamics, as derived in the given context?\nAnswer: "}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The equation that represents the conservation of mass in fluid dynamics is \u03c1t + \u2207\u00b7(\u03c1u) = 0."}]}

Describing the\n\ufb02ow sitting in the boat is equivalent to using the moving coordinate (X(\u03be,t),t).\nWhile the computation is easier in the Eulerian coordinate, the physical law is easier to\nbe described in the reference coordinates. For example, since X(\u03be,t)denotes the location\nof the parcel in space, its derivative respect to twill represent the velocity of the parcel \u03be.\nWe denote by\n(1) \u02dcu(\u03be,t) =\u2202X\n\u2202t(\u03be,t).\nWe now push forward the function to the Eulerian coordinate. Recall that the mapping X\nis one-to-one. So we can write \u03be=\u03be(x,t) :=X\u22121(x,t). HereX\u22121(\u00b7,t) :Rn\u2192Rnis\nthe map from Eulerian coordinate back to the reference coordinate. Therefore\nu(x,t) := \u02dcu(\u03be(x,t),t),or \u02dcu(\u03be,t) =u(x(\u03be,t),t).\nWith slight abuse of notation, the \u02dcis usually skipped, i.e., we use u(x,t)andu(\u03be,t)to\nrepresent the velocity in different coordinates. The same convention is applied to most\nfunctions.\nOn the other hand, given a smooth vector \ufb01eld u(x,t)in Eulerian coordinate, we can\nsolve the ODE systems\nd\ndtX(\u03be,t) =u(X(\u03be,t),t),t> 0,X(\u03be,0) =\u03be\nto \ufb01ndX(\u03be,t)the location of each parcel \u03beat any time t.

This could be a source of confusion\nwhen taking derivatives. In Eulerian coordinate, xandtare independent variables while\nin Lagrangian coordinate (x(\u03be,t),t) = (X(\u03be,t),t)the spatial variable is a function of t.\nTo avoid such confusion, let us treat the change from Eulerian coordinate to Lagrangian\ncoordinate as a change of variable\nx=x(\u03be,\u03c4), t=\u03c4.\nHere we use a different time variable \u03c4to indicate that in Lagrangian coordinate (x(\u03be,\u03c4),\u03c4),\nthe space and time variables are dependent.

For example, since uis the\nvelocity, then D\u03c4u=ut+ (u\u00b7\u2207)uis the acceleration of parcel \u03be.\nLet us take an arbitrary domain \u21260in the reference domain and denote \u2126\u03c4:=X(\u21260,\u03c4) =\n{x:x=x(\u03be,\u03c4),\u03be\u2208\u21260}as the deformed domain of \u21260at time\u03c4.\nWe now derive a formula for the material derivative of an integral\u222b\n\u2126\u03c4f(x,t) dxin the\nEulerian coordinate. Besides the derivative for f, we have to consider the change of the\ndomain \u2126\u03c4with respect to \u03c4.\nLemma 1.1. LetJ(\u03be,\u03c4) = (\u2202x/\u2202\u03be) = (\u2202xi/\u2202\u03bej)i,j=1,nbe the Jacobi matrix of the \ufb02ow\nmap, and let|J|= detJbe the Jacobian. Then\n(3) \u2202\u03c4|J|=|J|divu.\nProof. By changing of variables, the volume of \u2126\u03c4is\n|\u2126\u03c4|=\u222b\n\u2126\u03c41 dx=\u222b\n\u21260|J|d\u03be.\nWe then compute\n\u2202\u03c4|\u2126\u03c4|= lim\n\u2206\u03c4\u21920|\u2126\u03c4+\u2206\u03c4|\u2212|\u2126\u03c4|\n\u2206\u03c4.\nThe key observation is that the change of the volume is equal to the volume of the band\n|\u2126\u03c4+\u2206\u03c4|\u2212|\u2126\u03c4|=\u222b\n\u2202\u2126\u03c4(\u2206\u03c4)u\u00b7ndS,\nsince the boundary particles moving in the normal direction with velocity u\u00b7nin\u2206\u03c4time\nstep.

One parcel, labeled by \u03be, can be thought as\na boat.X(\u03be,t)is the position of the boat at time tdrifting down a river. Describing the\n\ufb02ow sitting in the boat is equivalent to using the moving coordinate (X(\u03be,t),t).\nWhile the computation is easier in the Eulerian coordinate, the physical law is easier to\nbe described in the reference coordinates. For example, since X(\u03be,t)denotes the location\nof the parcel in space, its derivative respect to twill represent the velocity of the parcel \u03be.\nWe denote by\n(1) \u02dcu(\u03be,t) =\u2202X\n\u2202t(\u03be,t).\nWe now push forward the function to the Eulerian coordinate. Recall that the mapping X\nis one-to-one. So we can write \u03be=\u03be(x,t) :=X\u22121(x,t). HereX\u22121(\u00b7,t) :Rn\u2192Rnis\nthe map from Eulerian coordinate back to the reference coordinate. Therefore\nu(x,t) := \u02dcu(\u03be(x,t),t),or \u02dcu(\u03be,t) =u(x(\u03be,t),t).\nWith slight abuse of notation, the \u02dcis usually skipped, i.e., we use u(x,t)andu(\u03be,t)to\nrepresent the velocity in different coordinates. The same convention is applied to most\nfunctions.\nOn the other hand, given a smooth vector \ufb01eld u(x,t)in Eulerian coordinate, we can\nsolve the ODE systems\nd\ndtX(\u03be,t) =u(X(\u03be,t),t),t> 0,X(\u03be,0) =\u03be\nto \ufb01ndX(\u03be,t)the location of each parcel \u03beat any time t. Thus it suf\ufb01ces to derive\nequations foruand solveuin Eulerian coordinate.\nTo save notation we still use xfor the mapping X(avoid typing capital letters and as-\nsume the function f(x)is better received than f(X)). This could be a source of confusion\nwhen taking derivatives. In Eulerian coordinate, xandtare independent variables while\nin Lagrangian coordinate (x(\u03be,t),t) = (X(\u03be,t),t)the spatial variable is a function of t.\nTo avoid such confusion, let us treat the change from Eulerian coordinate to Lagrangian\ncoordinate as a change of variable\nx=x(\u03be,\u03c4), t=\u03c4.\nHere we use a different time variable \u03c4to indicate that in Lagrangian coordinate (x(\u03be,\u03c4),\u03c4),\nthe space and time variables are dependent. That is xis independent of t(in Eulerian co-\nordinate) but dependent of \u03c4(in Lagrangian coordinate).\nWe summarize different coordinates below:\n\u2022Eulerian coordinate (x,t);\n\u2022Lagrangian coordinate (x(\u03be,\u03c4),\u03c4) = (X(\u03be,\u03c4),\u03c4);\n\u2022Reference coordinate (i.e. \u03c4= 0in Lagrangian coordinate) \u03be;\n1.2.

Conservation of energy. Now we have two equations: conservation of mass and\nconservation of momentum for three unknowns (\u03c1,u,p). To complete the system, we\nneed one additional equation for the conservation of energy.\nThe total energy consists of kinetic nervy and internal energy. The kinetic energy is\nEkinetic =1\n2\u222b\n\u2126\u03c1|u|2dx.\nThe internal energy Einternal is more complicated and a detailed explanation requires\nknowledge on thermodynamics.\nTo simplify the discussion, we shall restrict to incompressible \ufb02ow only. The following\nexercise will show that for incompressible \ufb02ow with constant internal energy, the balance\nof energy is implied by the momentum equation and thus will not introduce new equations.\nIn other words, for incompressible \ufb02uid, the system will be completed by the equation\ndivu= 0.\nExercise 1.6.

An important class of compressible \ufb02ow is\nisentropic \ufb02ow; see [1] (page 14).\n1.4. Naiver-Stokes equations.

Equations are written in the Eulerian coor-\ndinate but the derivation is easier in Lagrangian coordinate. We assume all functions are\nsmooth enough such that the differentiation and integration is interchangeable.\n1.3.1. Conservation of mass. The \ufb02uid parcel will move with the \ufb02uid \ufb02ow. Its shape\ncould change due to the distortion by the \ufb02ow while the mass of a \ufb02uid parcel remains\nconstant. This is considered as a basic principle of classical mechanics.\nLet us take an arbitrary domain \u21260in the reference coordinate and consider its defor-\nmation \u2126\u03c4at time\u03c4. The mass of the \ufb02uid inside the domain \u2126\u03c4is expressed as\nmass =\u222b\n\u2126\u03c4\u03c1(x,\u03c4) dx.\nConservation of mass implies that\nd\nd\u03c4(mass) = 0\u2212\u2192\u222b\n\u2126\u03c4D\u03c4\u03c1+\u03c1divudx=\u222b\n\u2126\u03c4\u03c1t+\u2207\u00b7(\u03c1u) dx= 0.\nSince the domain is arbitrary, we get the mass conservation (also known as continuity)\nequation\n(6) \u03c1t+\u2207\u00b7(\u03c1u) = 0.\nTo further illustrate the difference between Eulerian and Lagrangian coordinates, we\nderive (6) in Eulerian coordinate. Now take an arbitrary domain \u2126in Eulerian coordinate,\nwhich does not change in time. We consider the change of the mass in \u2126:\nd\ndt\u222b\n\u2126\u03c1(x,t)dx=\u222b\n\u2126\u2202t\u03c1(x,t)dx.\nThe change of mass is due to the fact that some \ufb02uid parcels \ufb02ow into or out of \u2126which is\ncharacterized by the surface integral of \ufb02ux\n\u2212\u222b\n\u2202\u2126\u03c1u\u00b7ndS.\nThe negative sign is chosen since nis the outwards normal direction and u\u00b7n>0means\nthe loss of mass.\nMass conservation is then described by\n\u222b\n\u2126\u2202t\u03c1(x,t)dx=\u2212\u222b\n\u2202\u2126\u03c1u\u00b7ndS.\n---------------------\nGiven the context information and not prior knowledge, answer the query.\nQuery: Question: What is the equation that represents the conservation of mass in fluid dynamics, as derived in the given context?\nAnswer: "}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The equation that represents the conservation of mass in fluid dynamics is \u03c1t + \u2207\u00b7(\u03c1u) = 0."}]}

B ASIC EQUATIONS FOR FLUID DYNAMICS\nIn this section, we derive the Navier-Stokes equations for the incompressible \ufb02uid.\n1.1. Eulerian and Lagrangian coordinates. Let us begin with Eulerian and Lagrangian\ncoordinates. The Eulerian coordinate (x,t)is the physical space plus time. The Eulerian\ndescription of the \ufb02ow is to describe the \ufb02ow using quantities as a function of a spatial\nlocationxand timet, e.g. the \ufb02ow velocity u(x,t). This can be visualized by sitting on\nthe bank of a river and watching the water pass a \ufb01xed location. The equations governing\nthe \ufb02ow will be mainly written and solved in the Eulerian coordinate.\nIn contrast, Lagrangian description can be visualized as sitting in a boat and drifting\ndown a river. To make it precise, let us introduce the reference coordinate \u03bewhich can\nbe thought as a (very \ufb01ne) uniform grid. Each cell is a \ufb02uid parcel which is a very small\namount of the \ufb02uid consisting of reasonable microscopic particles (molecules and atoms).\nThe size of \ufb02uid parcels is large enough such that the averaged quantities remains mean-\ningful. Meanwhile it is small compared to the macro length scales of the \ufb02ow under con-\nsideration such that it can be thought as a point.\nWe assume that the \ufb02ow starts from a reference con\ufb01guration and is mapped into its\ndeformed con\ufb01guration. Mathematically it can be described as a map, called \ufb02ow map ,\nfrom the reference coordinate to the Eulerian coordinate\nX(\u00b7,t) :Rn\u2192Rn,andX(\u00b7,0) = identity map .\nNamelyx=X(\u03be,t)is the spatial location of the parcel \u03bein the Eulerian coordinate\nat timet.

B ASIC EQUATIONS FOR FLUID DYNAMICS\nIn this section, we derive the Navier-Stokes equations for the incompressible \ufb02uid.\n1.1. Eulerian and Lagrangian coordinates. Let us begin with Eulerian and Lagrangian\ncoordinates. The Eulerian coordinate (x,t)is the physical space plus time. The Eulerian\ndescription of the \ufb02ow is to describe the \ufb02ow using quantities as a function of a spatial\nlocationxand timet, e.g. the \ufb02ow velocity u(x,t). This can be visualized by sitting on\nthe bank of a river and watching the water pass a \ufb01xed location. The equations governing\nthe \ufb02ow will be mainly written and solved in the Eulerian coordinate.\nIn contrast, Lagrangian description can be visualized as sitting in a boat and drifting\ndown a river. To make it precise, let us introduce the reference coordinate \u03bewhich can\nbe thought as a (very \ufb01ne) uniform grid. Each cell is a \ufb02uid parcel which is a very small\namount of the \ufb02uid consisting of reasonable microscopic particles (molecules and atoms).\nThe size of \ufb02uid parcels is large enough such that the averaged quantities remains mean-\ningful. Meanwhile it is small compared to the macro length scales of the \ufb02ow under con-\nsideration such that it can be thought as a point.\nWe assume that the \ufb02ow starts from a reference con\ufb01guration and is mapped into its\ndeformed con\ufb01guration. Mathematically it can be described as a map, called \ufb02ow map ,\nfrom the reference coordinate to the Eulerian coordinate\nX(\u00b7,t) :Rn\u2192Rn,andX(\u00b7,0) = identity map .\nNamelyx=X(\u03be,t)is the spatial location of the parcel \u03bein the Eulerian coordinate\nat timet. This map is one-to-one and assumed to be smooth (at least continuous and\ndifferentiable).\nDate : February 25, 2014.\n1\n---------------------\nGiven the context information and not prior knowledge, answer the query.\nQuery: Question: What is the relationship between the Lagrangian and Eulerian coordinates in the context of fluid dynamics?\nAnswer: "}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "In the context of fluid dynamics, the Eulerian and Lagrangian coordinates offer two different perspectives of observing the flow. The Eulerian coordinate, represented as (x,t), is the physical space plus time. It describes the flow using quantities as a function of a spatial location and time, such as the flow velocity u(x,t). This perspective can be visualized as sitting on the bank of a river and watching the water pass a fixed location. \n\nOn the other hand, the Lagrangian coordinate, represented as (X(\u03be,t),t), describes the flow from the perspective of a drifting boat. Here, \u03be is a reference coordinate that represents a fluid parcel, which is a very small amount of the fluid consisting of reasonable microscopic particles. X(\u03be,t) is the position of the boat (or fluid parcel) at time t drifting down a river. \n\nThe flow map X(\u00b7,t) maps the reference coordinate to the Eulerian coordinate, indicating the spatial location of the parcel \u03be in the Eulerian coordinate at time t. This map is one-to-one and assumed to be smooth. \n\nWhile computations are easier in the Eulerian coordinate, the physical law is easier to describe in the reference coordinates. For instance, the derivative of X(\u03be,t) with respect to t represents the velocity of the parcel \u03be. \n\nTo avoid confusion when taking derivatives, a change of variable is made when switching from Eulerian to Lagrangian coordinates. In Eulerian coordinate, x and t are independent variables, while in Lagrangian coordinate, the spatial variable is a function of t. \n\nIn summary, Eulerian and Lagrangian coordinates provide two different ways to describe and analyze fluid flow, each with its own advantages and considerations."}]}

The mass of the \ufb02uid inside the domain \u2126\u03c4is expressed as\nmass =\u222b\n\u2126\u03c4\u03c1(x,\u03c4) dx.\nConservation of mass implies that\nd\nd\u03c4(mass) = 0\u2212\u2192\u222b\n\u2126\u03c4D\u03c4\u03c1+\u03c1divudx=\u222b\n\u2126\u03c4\u03c1t+\u2207\u00b7(\u03c1u) dx= 0.\nSince the domain is arbitrary, we get the mass conservation (also known as continuity)\nequation\n(6) \u03c1t+\u2207\u00b7(\u03c1u) = 0.\nTo further illustrate the difference between Eulerian and Lagrangian coordinates, we\nderive (6) in Eulerian coordinate. Now take an arbitrary domain \u2126in Eulerian coordinate,\nwhich does not change in time. We consider the change of the mass in \u2126:\nd\ndt\u222b\n\u2126\u03c1(x,t)dx=\u222b\n\u2126\u2202t\u03c1(x,t)dx.\nThe change of mass is due to the fact that some \ufb02uid parcels \ufb02ow into or out of \u2126which is\ncharacterized by the surface integral of \ufb02ux\n\u2212\u222b\n\u2202\u2126\u03c1u\u00b7ndS.\nThe negative sign is chosen since nis the outwards normal direction and u\u00b7n>0means\nthe loss of mass.\nMass conservation is then described by\n\u222b\n\u2126\u2202t\u03c1(x,t)dx=\u2212\u222b\n\u2202\u2126\u03c1u\u00b7ndS.\n---------------------\nGiven the context information and not prior knowledge, answer the query.\nQuery: Question: What is the equation that represents the conservation of mass in fluid dynamics, as derived in the given context?\nAnswer: "}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The equation that represents the conservation of mass in fluid dynamics is \u03c1t + \u2207\u00b7(\u03c1u) = 0."}]}

Incompressible \ufb02uid. The \ufb02uid is called incompressible ifD\u03c4\u03c1= 0, i.e., the mass\ndensity of \ufb02uid parcels does not change during the moving.\nFor incompressible \ufb02ow, the continuity equation is simpli\ufb01ed to\n(7) divu= 0.\nPhysically, or mathematically by (3), the volume of \ufb02uid parcels does not change. Note\nthat due to the continuity equation D\u03c4\u03c1+\u03c1divu= 0, we have\nD\u03c4\u03c1= 0\u21d0\u21d2 divu= 0\nBy the formulae on Jacobian (3), we conclude for incompressible \ufb02uid, the Jacobian is\nconstant and since |J(0)|= 1, this constant is one. As a consequence, the volume of \u2126\u03c4\ndoes not change.\nFor incompressible \ufb02uid, since divu= 0, we then have\n(8)d\nd\u03c4(\u222b\n\u2126\u03c4f(x,\u03c4) dx)\n=\u222b\n\u2126\u03c4D\u03c4f(x,\u03c4) dx=\u222b\n\u2126\u03c4(ft+u\u00b7\u2207f) dx.\nFormally we can exchange the integration and the derivative and safely skip the effect from\nthe changing of the domain.\n1.3.3. Conservation of momentum. The momentum is given by\nmomentum =\u222b\n\u2126\u03c4\u03c1udx.\nBy Newton\u2019s second law, we have\nd\nd\u03c4(momentum) = force(\u2126 \u03c4),\nwhere force(\u2126t)is the force acting on the domain \u2126\u03c4.\nWe \ufb01rst \ufb01gure out the formula for the change of momentum.\nTheorem 1.4 (Transport theorem II) .For a smooth function f(x,t), we have:\nd\nd\u03c4(\u222b\n\u2126\u03c4\u03c1f(x,\u03c4) dx)\n=\u222b\n\u2126\u03c4\u03c1D\u03c4f(x,\u03c4) dx=\u222b\n\u2126\u03c4\u03c1(ft+u\u00b7\u2207f) dx.\nProof. By transport theorem I (Theorem 1.3), and the chain rule, we have\nd\nd\u03c4(\u222b\n\u2126\u03c4\u03c1fdx)\n=\u222b\n\u2126\u03c4D\u03c4(\u03c1f) dx+\u222b\n\u2126\u03c4\u03c1fdivudx\n=\u222b\n\u2126\u03c4\u03c1D\u03c4fdx+\u222b\n\u2126\u03c4fD\u03c4\u03c1dx+\u222b\n\u2126\u03c4f\u03c1divudx\n=\u222b\n\u2126\u03c4\u03c1D\u03c4fdx.\nThe last two terms canceled because of the conservation of mass, c.f. (6). \u25a1\nThis is a generalization of (8) if we treat \u03c1dxas a new measure. Formally it is the\nexchange of integral and material derivative.\nApply Theorem 1.4 to the momentum, we get\nd\nd\u03c4(momentum) =\u222b\n\u2126\u03c4\u03c1(ut+u\u00b7\u2207u) dx.\n\npage_label: 10\nfile_path: src\\test\\regression\\regression_test004\\NavierStokesPDE.pdf\n\n10 LONG CHEN\n1.6.
