B ASIC EQUATIONS FOR FLUID DYNAMICS\nIn this section, we derive the Navier-Stokes equations for the incompressible \ufb02uid.\n1.1. Eulerian and Lagrangian coordinates. Let us begin with Eulerian and Lagrangian\ncoordinates. The Eulerian coordinate (x,t)is the physical space plus time. The Eulerian\ndescription of the \ufb02ow is to describe the \ufb02ow using quantities as a function of a spatial\nlocationxand timet, e.g. the \ufb02ow velocity u(x,t). This can be visualized by sitting on\nthe bank of a river and watching the water pass a \ufb01xed location. The equations governing\nthe \ufb02ow will be mainly written and solved in the Eulerian coordinate.\nIn contrast, Lagrangian description can be visualized as sitting in a boat and drifting\ndown a river. To make it precise, let us introduce the reference coordinate \u03bewhich can\nbe thought as a (very \ufb01ne) uniform grid. Each cell is a \ufb02uid parcel which is a very small\namount of the \ufb02uid consisting of reasonable microscopic particles (molecules and atoms).\nThe size of \ufb02uid parcels is large enough such that the averaged quantities remains mean-\ningful. Meanwhile it is small compared to the macro length scales of the \ufb02ow under con-\nsideration such that it can be thought as a point.\nWe assume that the \ufb02ow starts from a reference con\ufb01guration and is mapped into its\ndeformed con\ufb01guration. Mathematically it can be described as a map, called \ufb02ow map ,\nfrom the reference coordinate to the Eulerian coordinate\nX(\u00b7,t) :Rn\u2192Rn,andX(\u00b7,0) = identity map .\nNamelyx=X(\u03be,t)is the spatial location of the parcel \u03bein the Eulerian coordinate\nat timet. This map is one-to-one and assumed to be smooth (at least continuous and\ndifferentiable).\nDate : February 25, 2014.\n1\n---------------------\nGiven the context information and not prior knowledge, answer the query.\nQuery: What is the difference between the Navier-Stokes equation and the Euler equation?\nAnswer: "}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The Navier-Stokes equation and the Euler equation are both mathematical models used in fluid dynamics. The Navier-Stokes equation accounts for the effects of viscosity in the fluid, making it a second-order equation. On the other hand, the Euler equation is a special case of the Navier-Stokes equation where the viscosity is considered to be zero, which makes it a first-order equation. This occurs in the limiting case when the Reynolds number (Re) is infinity. The fluid modeled by the Euler equation is referred to as an ideal fluid."}]}

AsReincreases, the equation becomes inviscid. From the de\ufb01nition of Re, for\nlarge scale problem ( LorUbig), the viscosity is tiny. In the limiting case, Re=\u221e,\u00b5= 0,\nNavier-Stokes equation becomes the so-called Euler equation. The \ufb02uid is called ideal\n\ufb02uid. Note that N-S equation is second order while Euler is \ufb01rst order. The boundary\nconditionsu= 0should be changed accordingly to u\u00b7n= 0. If there is a mismatch in the\nboundary condition, it cause problems near the boundary, known as boundary layer effect;\nsee [1] for details.\nThere are mainly three dif\ufb01culties associated to the Navier-Stokes equations:\n(1) First it is time dependent. Stability in time could be an issue for both PDE and\nnumerical methods.

But the convection u\u00b7\u2207derivative, especially when\nit is dominate ( \u00b5\u226a1), will cause a serious trouble in the numerical computation.\n(3) Third it is a coupled system of (u,p). The pressure pcan be eliminate if we\nconsideruin the exactly divergence free space. But the divergence free condition\nis hardly to impose in numerical methods.\nWe shall solve this tangle by focusing on one dif\ufb01culty at a time. We \ufb01rst skip the time\nderivative and nonlinearity to get the steady-state Stokes equations\n\u2212\u00b5\u2206u+\u2207p=f, (13)\ndivu= 0. (14)\nand will study Stokes equations in detail in the next Chapter.\n1.5. Different formulations.\n1.5.1. Lagrangian formulation. We use material derivative to write the equations as\n\u03c1D\u03c4u+\u2207p=\u03c1f,\nD\u03c4\u03c1= 0,\ndivu= 0.\nThis formulation is useful for numerical methods based on Lagrangian coordinate includ-\ning semi-Lagrangian method and characteristic method.\n1.5.2. Vorticity-Velocity-Pressure formulation. We introduce the vorticity w=\u2207\u00d7u\nwhich is a vector function in three dimensions and a scalar function in two dimensions.\nFor a two dimensional velocity u= (u1,u2), the\u2207\u00d7 is applied to (u1,u2,0)and only\nnonzero component is kept, i.e., \u2207\u00d7u=\u22021u2\u2212\u22022u1.\nUsing the identity\n(15) (u\u00b7\u2207)u= (curlu)\u00d7u+1\n2\u2207(|u|2)\nwe can obtain the rotation form of the Navier-Stokes equations:\n\u2212\u00b5\u2206u+\u2202tu+w\u00d7u+\u2207P=f,\ndivu= 0,w=\u2207\u00d7u.\n\npage_label: 9\nfile_path: test\\regression\\regression_test004\\NavierStokesPDE.pdf\n\nNA VIER-STOKES EQUATIONS FOR FLUID DYNAMICS 9\nwhere the kinematic pressure is replaced by the Bernoulli (or dynamic) pressure P=\np+|u|2/2. Note that the boundary condition is only imposed on the velocity ubut no\nboundary condition for vorticity w.\nUsing the identity\n\u2212\u2206u=\u2207\u00d7\u2207\u00d7u\u2212\u2207\u2207\u00b7u\nanddivu= 0, the momentum equation can be rewritten as\n\u2212\u00b5\u2207\u00d7w+\u2202tu+w\u00d7u+\u2207P=f.\n1.5.3. Vorticity-Velocity formulation. It is advantageous to describe dynamics of a \ufb02ow in\nterms of the evolution of the vorticity. In 3-D, taking curl of equations (11) and combining\nthe equation (12), we obtain the vorticity-velocity formulation\n\u2212\u00b5\u2206w+D\u03c4w\u2212(w\u00b7\u2207)u=\u2207\u00d7f,\ndivu= 0,w=\u2207\u00d7u.\nOne of the main advantages of this formulation is the elimination of the pressure.\nFor two dimensional incompressible \ufb02ow, the equation is\nD\u03c4w\u2212\u00b5\u2206w=\u2207\u00d7f,\ndivu= 0, w =\u2207\u00d7u.\n1.5.4. Vorticity-Stream function formulation. Suppose \u2126is a simply connected (\u2018no holes\u2019)\ndomain in two dimensions. Since divu= 0, there exists a function \u03c8such thatu=\u2207\u00d7\u03c8.\nHere the\u2207\u00d7applied to a scalar function \u03c8can be thought as\u2207\u00d7(0,0,\u03c8), i.e.,\u2207\u00d7\u03c8=\n(\u22022\u03c8,\u2212\u22021\u03c8). The function \u03c8is called stream function. Note that \u2207\u00d7\u2207\u00d7\u03c8= \u2206\u03c8.\nIn two dimensions, the vorticity-stream function formulation consists of a convection-\ndiffusion equation for the vorticity and a Poisson equation for the stream function:\n\u2202tw+ (\u2207\u00d7\u03c8)\u00b7\u2207w\u2212\u00b5\u2206w=\u2207\u00d7f, (16)\n\u25b3\u03c8+w= 0. (17)\nThe boundary condition u= 0 on\u2202\u2126will be transformed to \u03c8= 0 and\u2202n\u03c8= 0. The\nDirichlet boundary condition \u03c8= 0is easy to impose but the Neumann boundary condition\n\u2202n\u03c8= 0can be only imposed weakly through the weak formulation of (17).\n1.5.5. Vorticity-Velocity-Stream function formulation. For three dimensional incompress-\nible \ufb02ow, the stream function is a little bit complicated. First of all from divu= 0to write\nu=\u2207\u00d7A, we require the domain contains no \u2018solid holes\u2019. The vector function Ais not\nunique asA+ grad\u03c6for any smooth enough \u03c6will still giveu=\u2207\u00d7A. To eliminate\nsuch freedom, we can further ask divA= 0. Then the equation\nw= curl\u00d7u= curl\u00d7curl\u00d7A=\u2212\u2206A.\nWe obtain a vorticity-velocity-stream function formulation of Navier-Stokes equations\n\u2212\u00b5\u2206w+D\u03c4w\u2212(w\u00b7\u2207)u=\u2207\u00d7f,\nw+ \u2206A= 0,divA= 0,w=\u2207\u00d7u.\nAgain the boundary condition for AisA\u00d7n= 0which implies u\u00b7n= 0. The tangential\nboundary condition of ucan be imposed weakly in the equation w=\u2207\u00d7u.\n---------------------\nGiven the context information and not prior knowledge, answer the query.\nQuery: What are the boundary conditions for the Euler equation?\nAnswer: "}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The boundary conditions for the Euler equation should be changed from u= 0 to u\u00b7n= 0."}]}

Conservation of energy. Now we have two equations: conservation of mass and\nconservation of momentum for three unknowns (\u03c1,u,p). To complete the system, we\nneed one additional equation for the conservation of energy.\nThe total energy consists of kinetic nervy and internal energy. The kinetic energy is\nEkinetic =1\n2\u222b\n\u2126\u03c1|u|2dx.\nThe internal energy Einternal is more complicated and a detailed explanation requires\nknowledge on thermodynamics.\nTo simplify the discussion, we shall restrict to incompressible \ufb02ow only. The following\nexercise will show that for incompressible \ufb02ow with constant internal energy, the balance\nof energy is implied by the momentum equation and thus will not introduce new equations.\nIn other words, for incompressible \ufb02uid, the system will be completed by the equation\ndivu= 0.\nExercise 1.6.

Conservation of energy. Now we have two equations: conservation of mass and\nconservation of momentum for three unknowns (\u03c1,u,p). To complete the system, we\nneed one additional equation for the conservation of energy.\nThe total energy consists of kinetic nervy and internal energy. The kinetic energy is\nEkinetic =1\n2\u222b\n\u2126\u03c1|u|2dx.\nThe internal energy Einternal is more complicated and a detailed explanation requires\nknowledge on thermodynamics.\nTo simplify the discussion, we shall restrict to incompressible \ufb02ow only. The following\nexercise will show that for incompressible \ufb02ow with constant internal energy, the balance\nof energy is implied by the momentum equation and thus will not introduce new equations.\nIn other words, for incompressible \ufb02uid, the system will be completed by the equation\ndivu= 0.\nExercise 1.6. Leteinternal be the density of the internal energy. The total energy density\nwill beetotal=einternal +|u|2/2. The change of energy of \u2126\u03c4of the \ufb02uid should be the\nsame as the work done by body forces and surface forces times the distance.

An important class of compressible \ufb02ow is\nisentropic \ufb02ow; see [1] (page 14).\n1.4. Naiver-Stokes equations.

B ASIC EQUATIONS FOR FLUID DYNAMICS\nIn this section, we derive the Navier-Stokes equations for the incompressible \ufb02uid.\n1.1. Eulerian and Lagrangian coordinates. Let us begin with Eulerian and Lagrangian\ncoordinates. The Eulerian coordinate (x,t)is the physical space plus time. The Eulerian\ndescription of the \ufb02ow is to describe the \ufb02ow using quantities as a function of a spatial\nlocationxand timet, e.g. the \ufb02ow velocity u(x,t). This can be visualized by sitting on\nthe bank of a river and watching the water pass a \ufb01xed location. The equations governing\nthe \ufb02ow will be mainly written and solved in the Eulerian coordinate.\nIn contrast, Lagrangian description can be visualized as sitting in a boat and drifting\ndown a river. To make it precise, let us introduce the reference coordinate \u03bewhich can\nbe thought as a (very \ufb01ne) uniform grid. Each cell is a \ufb02uid parcel which is a very small\namount of the \ufb02uid consisting of reasonable microscopic particles (molecules and atoms).\nThe size of \ufb02uid parcels is large enough such that the averaged quantities remains mean-\ningful. Meanwhile it is small compared to the macro length scales of the \ufb02ow under con-\nsideration such that it can be thought as a point.\nWe assume that the \ufb02ow starts from a reference con\ufb01guration and is mapped into its\ndeformed con\ufb01guration. Mathematically it can be described as a map, called \ufb02ow map ,\nfrom the reference coordinate to the Eulerian coordinate\nX(\u00b7,t) :Rn\u2192Rn,andX(\u00b7,0) = identity map .\nNamelyx=X(\u03be,t)is the spatial location of the parcel \u03bein the Eulerian coordinate\nat timet. This map is one-to-one and assumed to be smooth (at least continuous and\ndifferentiable).\nDate : February 25, 2014.\n1\n---------------------\nGiven the context information and not prior knowledge, answer the query.\nQuery: What is the Lagrangian formulation of the Navier-Stokes equations and when is it useful?\nAnswer: "}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The Lagrangian formulation of the Navier-Stokes equations is expressed using the material derivative.

Since the domain is changing with respect to \u03c4, we go back to the reference domain\n\u21260and apply the formula (3) to get\nd\nd\u03c4(\u222b\n\u2126\u03c4f(x,t) dx)\n=d\nd\u03c4(\u222b\n\u21260f(x(\u03be,\u03c4),\u03c4)|J|d\u03be)\n=\u222b\n\u21260D\u03c4f(x(\u03be,\u03c4),\u03c4)|J|d\u03be+\u222b\n\u21260f(x(\u03be,\u03c4),\u03c4)\u2202\u03c4|J|d\u03be\n=\u222b\n\u21260(ft+u\u00b7\u2207f+fdivu)|J|d\u03be\n=\u222b\n\u2126\u03c4(ft+\u2207\u00b7(fu)) dx.\n\u25a1\n1.3. Conservation laws. We now derive fundamental equations for \ufb02uid. Let (\u03c1,u)de-\nnotes the mass density and velocity of \ufb02uid. Equations are written in the Eulerian coor-\ndinate but the derivation is easier in Lagrangian coordinate. We assume all functions are\nsmooth enough such that the differentiation and integration is interchangeable.\n1.3.1. Conservation of mass. The \ufb02uid parcel will move with the \ufb02uid \ufb02ow. Its shape\ncould change due to the distortion by the \ufb02ow while the mass of a \ufb02uid parcel remains\nconstant. This is considered as a basic principle of classical mechanics.\nLet us take an arbitrary domain \u21260in the reference coordinate and consider its defor-\nmation \u2126\u03c4at time\u03c4.

One parcel, labeled by \u03be, can be thought as\na boat.X(\u03be,t)is the position of the boat at time tdrifting down a river. Describing the\n\ufb02ow sitting in the boat is equivalent to using the moving coordinate (X(\u03be,t),t).\nWhile the computation is easier in the Eulerian coordinate, the physical law is easier to\nbe described in the reference coordinates. For example, since X(\u03be,t)denotes the location\nof the parcel in space, its derivative respect to twill represent the velocity of the parcel \u03be.\nWe denote by\n(1) \u02dcu(\u03be,t) =\u2202X\n\u2202t(\u03be,t).\nWe now push forward the function to the Eulerian coordinate. Recall that the mapping X\nis one-to-one. So we can write \u03be=\u03be(x,t) :=X\u22121(x,t). HereX\u22121(\u00b7,t) :Rn\u2192Rnis\nthe map from Eulerian coordinate back to the reference coordinate. Therefore\nu(x,t) := \u02dcu(\u03be(x,t),t),or \u02dcu(\u03be,t) =u(x(\u03be,t),t).\nWith slight abuse of notation, the \u02dcis usually skipped, i.e., we use u(x,t)andu(\u03be,t)to\nrepresent the velocity in different coordinates. The same convention is applied to most\nfunctions.\nOn the other hand, given a smooth vector \ufb01eld u(x,t)in Eulerian coordinate, we can\nsolve the ODE systems\nd\ndtX(\u03be,t) =u(X(\u03be,t),t),t> 0,X(\u03be,0) =\u03be\nto \ufb01ndX(\u03be,t)the location of each parcel \u03beat any time t. Thus it suf\ufb01ces to derive\nequations foruand solveuin Eulerian coordinate.\nTo save notation we still use xfor the mapping X(avoid typing capital letters and as-\nsume the function f(x)is better received than f(X)). This could be a source of confusion\nwhen taking derivatives. In Eulerian coordinate, xandtare independent variables while\nin Lagrangian coordinate (x(\u03be,t),t) = (X(\u03be,t),t)the spatial variable is a function of t.\nTo avoid such confusion, let us treat the change from Eulerian coordinate to Lagrangian\ncoordinate as a change of variable\nx=x(\u03be,\u03c4), t=\u03c4.\nHere we use a different time variable \u03c4to indicate that in Lagrangian coordinate (x(\u03be,\u03c4),\u03c4),\nthe space and time variables are dependent.

Given a parcel \u2126\u03c4in the \ufb02uid, forces can be classi\ufb01ed into\ntwo category: body (external) force or surface force of stress. Examples of body force are\nthe gravity or the magnetism. The action can be written as\u222b\n\u2126\u03c4fdx. The stress can be\nfurther decomposed as pressure force and stress tensor.

Its shape\ncould change due to the distortion by the \ufb02ow while the mass of a \ufb02uid parcel remains\nconstant. This is considered as a basic principle of classical mechanics.\nLet us take an arbitrary domain \u21260in the reference coordinate and consider its defor-\nmation \u2126\u03c4at time\u03c4.

Let us begin with Eulerian and Lagrangian\ncoordinates. The Eulerian coordinate (x,t)is the physical space plus time. The Eulerian\ndescription of the \ufb02ow is to describe the \ufb02ow using quantities as a function of a spatial\nlocationxand timet, e.g. the \ufb02ow velocity u(x,t). This can be visualized by sitting on\nthe bank of a river and watching the water pass a \ufb01xed location. The equations governing\nthe \ufb02ow will be mainly written and solved in the Eulerian coordinate.\nIn contrast, Lagrangian description can be visualized as sitting in a boat and drifting\ndown a river. To make it precise, let us introduce the reference coordinate \u03bewhich can\nbe thought as a (very \ufb01ne) uniform grid. Each cell is a \ufb02uid parcel which is a very small\namount of the \ufb02uid consisting of reasonable microscopic particles (molecules and atoms).\nThe size of \ufb02uid parcels is large enough such that the averaged quantities remains mean-\ningful. Meanwhile it is small compared to the macro length scales of the \ufb02ow under con-\nsideration such that it can be thought as a point.\nWe assume that the \ufb02ow starts from a reference con\ufb01guration and is mapped into its\ndeformed con\ufb01guration. Mathematically it can be described as a map, called \ufb02ow map ,\nfrom the reference coordinate to the Eulerian coordinate\nX(\u00b7,t) :Rn\u2192Rn,andX(\u00b7,0) = identity map .\nNamelyx=X(\u03be,t)is the spatial location of the parcel \u03bein the Eulerian coordinate\nat timet.

Here the material refer to \ufb02uid parcels.

The temporal change ftis\nobserved in Eulerian coordinate (sitting still and track the rate of change of fin time). The\nother part is due to spatial change in the moving coordinate: we are in different locations\nat different time!\nIn the literature usually it is denoted by Dtord/dt .

One parcel, labeled by \u03be, can be thought as\na boat.X(\u03be,t)is the position of the boat at time tdrifting down a river. Describing the\n\ufb02ow sitting in the boat is equivalent to using the moving coordinate (X(\u03be,t),t).\nWhile the computation is easier in the Eulerian coordinate, the physical law is easier to\nbe described in the reference coordinates. For example, since X(\u03be,t)denotes the location\nof the parcel in space, its derivative respect to twill represent the velocity of the parcel \u03be.\nWe denote by\n(1) \u02dcu(\u03be,t) =\u2202X\n\u2202t(\u03be,t).\nWe now push forward the function to the Eulerian coordinate. Recall that the mapping X\nis one-to-one. So we can write \u03be=\u03be(x,t) :=X\u22121(x,t). HereX\u22121(\u00b7,t) :Rn\u2192Rnis\nthe map from Eulerian coordinate back to the reference coordinate. Therefore\nu(x,t) := \u02dcu(\u03be(x,t),t),or \u02dcu(\u03be,t) =u(x(\u03be,t),t).\nWith slight abuse of notation, the \u02dcis usually skipped, i.e., we use u(x,t)andu(\u03be,t)to\nrepresent the velocity in different coordinates. The same convention is applied to most\nfunctions.\nOn the other hand, given a smooth vector \ufb01eld u(x,t)in Eulerian coordinate, we can\nsolve the ODE systems\nd\ndtX(\u03be,t) =u(X(\u03be,t),t),t> 0,X(\u03be,0) =\u03be\nto \ufb01ndX(\u03be,t)the location of each parcel \u03beat any time t. Thus it suf\ufb01ces to derive\nequations foruand solveuin Eulerian coordinate.\nTo save notation we still use xfor the mapping X(avoid typing capital letters and as-\nsume the function f(x)is better received than f(X)). This could be a source of confusion\nwhen taking derivatives. In Eulerian coordinate, xandtare independent variables while\nin Lagrangian coordinate (x(\u03be,t),t) = (X(\u03be,t),t)the spatial variable is a function of t.\nTo avoid such confusion, let us treat the change from Eulerian coordinate to Lagrangian\ncoordinate as a change of variable\nx=x(\u03be,\u03c4), t=\u03c4.\nHere we use a different time variable \u03c4to indicate that in Lagrangian coordinate (x(\u03be,\u03c4),\u03c4),\nthe space and time variables are dependent. That is xis independent of t(in Eulerian co-\nordinate) but dependent of \u03c4(in Lagrangian coordinate).\nWe summarize different coordinates below:\n\u2022Eulerian coordinate (x,t);\n\u2022Lagrangian coordinate (x(\u03be,\u03c4),\u03c4) = (X(\u03be,\u03c4),\u03c4);\n\u2022Reference coordinate (i.e. \u03c4= 0in Lagrangian coordinate) \u03be;\n1.2.

Conservation of energy. Now we have two equations: conservation of mass and\nconservation of momentum for three unknowns (\u03c1,u,p). To complete the system, we\nneed one additional equation for the conservation of energy.\nThe total energy consists of kinetic nervy and internal energy. The kinetic energy is\nEkinetic =1\n2\u222b\n\u2126\u03c1|u|2dx.\nThe internal energy Einternal is more complicated and a detailed explanation requires\nknowledge on thermodynamics.\nTo simplify the discussion, we shall restrict to incompressible \ufb02ow only. The following\nexercise will show that for incompressible \ufb02ow with constant internal energy, the balance\nof energy is implied by the momentum equation and thus will not introduce new equations.\nIn other words, for incompressible \ufb02uid, the system will be completed by the equation\ndivu= 0.\nExercise 1.6. Leteinternal be the density of the internal energy. The total energy density\nwill beetotal=einternal +|u|2/2. The change of energy of \u2126\u03c4of the \ufb02uid should be the\nsame as the work done by body forces and surface forces times the distance. Thus the rate\nof change of the work is F(\u2126\u03c4)\u00b7u.

And show it is equivalent to the momentum\nequation.\nFor compressible \ufb02ow, we need an additional relation between pressure pand density\u03c1\nderived from the \ufb01rst law of thermodynamics. An important class of compressible \ufb02ow is\nisentropic \ufb02ow; see [1] (page 14).\n1.4. Naiver-Stokes equations.

Conservation laws. We now derive fundamental equations for \ufb02uid. Let (\u03c1,u)de-\nnotes the mass density and velocity of \ufb02uid. Equations are written in the Eulerian coor-\ndinate but the derivation is easier in Lagrangian coordinate. We assume all functions are\nsmooth enough such that the differentiation and integration is interchangeable.\n1.3.1. Conservation of mass. The \ufb02uid parcel will move with the \ufb02uid \ufb02ow. Its shape\ncould change due to the distortion by the \ufb02ow while the mass of a \ufb02uid parcel remains\nconstant. This is considered as a basic principle of classical mechanics.\nLet us take an arbitrary domain \u21260in the reference coordinate and consider its defor-\nmation \u2126\u03c4at time\u03c4. The mass of the \ufb02uid inside the domain \u2126\u03c4is expressed as\nmass =\u222b\n\u2126\u03c4\u03c1(x,\u03c4) dx.\nConservation of mass implies that\nd\nd\u03c4(mass) = 0\u2212\u2192\u222b\n\u2126\u03c4D\u03c4\u03c1+\u03c1divudx=\u222b\n\u2126\u03c4\u03c1t+\u2207\u00b7(\u03c1u) dx= 0.\nSince the domain is arbitrary, we get the mass conservation (also known as continuity)\nequation\n(6) \u03c1t+\u2207\u00b7(\u03c1u) = 0.\nTo further illustrate the difference between Eulerian and Lagrangian coordinates, we\nderive (6) in Eulerian coordinate. Now take an arbitrary domain \u2126in Eulerian coordinate,\nwhich does not change in time. We consider the change of the mass in \u2126:\nd\ndt\u222b\n\u2126\u03c1(x,t)dx=\u222b\n\u2126\u2202t\u03c1(x,t)dx.\nThe change of mass is due to the fact that some \ufb02uid parcels \ufb02ow into or out of \u2126which is\ncharacterized by the surface integral of \ufb02ux\n\u2212\u222b\n\u2202\u2126\u03c1u\u00b7ndS.\nThe negative sign is chosen since nis the outwards normal direction and u\u00b7n>0means\nthe loss of mass.\nMass conservation is then described by\n\u222b\n\u2126\u2202t\u03c1(x,t)dx=\u2212\u222b\n\u2202\u2126\u03c1u\u00b7ndS.\n---------------------\nGiven the context information and not prior knowledge, answer the query.\nQuery: How can the boundary condition u=0 on \u2202\u2126 be transformed in the vorticity-stream function formulation?\nAnswer: "}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "In the vorticity-stream function formulation, the boundary condition u=0 on \u2202\u2126 is transformed to \u03c8=0 and \u2202n\u03c8=0."}]}

Conservation of energy. Now we have two equations: conservation of mass and\nconservation of momentum for three unknowns (\u03c1,u,p). To complete the system, we\nneed one additional equation for the conservation of energy.\nThe total energy consists of kinetic nervy and internal energy. The kinetic energy is\nEkinetic =1\n2\u222b\n\u2126\u03c1|u|2dx.\nThe internal energy Einternal is more complicated and a detailed explanation requires\nknowledge on thermodynamics.\nTo simplify the discussion, we shall restrict to incompressible \ufb02ow only. The following\nexercise will show that for incompressible \ufb02ow with constant internal energy, the balance\nof energy is implied by the momentum equation and thus will not introduce new equations.\nIn other words, for incompressible \ufb02uid, the system will be completed by the equation\ndivu= 0.\nExercise 1.6. Leteinternal be the density of the internal energy. The total energy density\nwill beetotal=einternal +|u|2/2. The change of energy of \u2126\u03c4of the \ufb02uid should be the\nsame as the work done by body forces and surface forces times the distance. Thus the rate\nof change of the work is F(\u2126\u03c4)\u00b7u. Simplify the conservation of energy\nD\u03c4\u222b\n\u2126\u03c4\u03c1etotaldx=F(\u2126\u03c4)\u00b7u\nfor incompressible \ufb02ow with constant einternal . And show it is equivalent to the momentum\nequation.\nFor compressible \ufb02ow, we need an additional relation between pressure pand density\u03c1\nderived from the \ufb01rst law of thermodynamics. An important class of compressible \ufb02ow is\nisentropic \ufb02ow; see [1] (page 14).\n1.4. Naiver-Stokes equations. For incompressible, viscous and Newtonian \ufb02uid, we then\nobtain the Naiver-Stokes equation (plus suitable boundary and initial conditions).\n\u2212\u00b5\u2206u+\u03c1(ut+ (u\u00b7\u2207)u) +\u2207p=f,\n\u03c1t+u\u00b7\u2207\u03c1= 0,\ndivu= 0.\nIn this note, we consider the constant mass density.

The mass equation is equivalent to\nthe incompressible equation.\nNow let us consider the non-dimensionalization by the transformation\n\u00afu=u/U,\u00afp=p/U2,\u00afx=x/L, and\u00aft=t/T.\nThen the momentum equation (11) becomes\n\u00afu\u00aft+\u00afu\u00b7\u2207\u00afu\u22121\nRe\u2206\u00afu+\u2207\u00afp=f,\nwhere\nRe=LU/\u00b5.\n\npage_label: 6\nfile_path: test\\regression\\regression_test004\\NavierStokesPDE.pdf\n\n6 LONG CHEN\nRecall thatut+u\u00b7\u2207u=D\u03c4uis the acceleration. The momentum equation is the integral\nform of the Newton\u2019s second law F=ma.\nWe then look at the force. Given a parcel \u2126\u03c4in the \ufb02uid, forces can be classi\ufb01ed into\ntwo category: body (external) force or surface force of stress. Examples of body force are\nthe gravity or the magnetism. The action can be written as\u222b\n\u2126\u03c4fdx. The stress can be\nfurther decomposed as pressure force and stress tensor. The pressure force on the boundary\nis given by\u2212\u222b\n\u2202\u2126\u03c4pndS=\u2212\u222b\n\u2126\u03c4\u2207pdx. Here the negative sign is due to the outward\nnormalnis used. The pressure force is always in the normal direction. Another surface\nforce is coming from the deformation of the material:\u222b\n\u2202\u2126t\u03c3ndS. Here\u03c3(x,t)is a matrix\nfunction and\u03c3ncontains forces not only in the normal direction but also in the tangential\ndirection. The stress can be uni\ufb01ed as \u2212pI+\u03c3. If only pressure force exists, we can the\n\ufb02uid idea \ufb02uid .\nThe momentum equation becomes\n\u03c1D\u03c4u=f\u2212\u2207p+ div\u03c3(u) =f+ div(\u2212pI+\u03c3(u)).\nWe now focus on the formula for the stress tensor \u03c3. We assume that\n(1)\u03c3=\u03c3(\u2207u)is linear in\u2207uwhich is called Newtonian \ufb02uid . If not, it is called\nnon-Newtonian \ufb02uid .\n(2) It is invariant with respect to the rotation Rin the Eulerian coordinate. Namely\n\u03c3(R\u2207uR\u22121) =R\u03c3(\u2207u)R\u22121.\n(3) It is symmetric, i.e. \u03c3=\u03c3T.\nA commonly used formula for the viscosity \u03c3satisfying the above assumptions is\n(9)\u03c3=\u03bb(divu)I+ 2\u00b5\u2207(s)u,with\u2207(s)u=\u2207u+ (\u2207u)T\n2,\nwhere\u03bb,\u00b5 are two positive parameters and \u2207(s)uis known as the symmetric gradient or\nthe deformation tensor.\nLemma 1.5. For\u03c3given by (9), we have\ndiv\u03c3=\u00b5\u2206u+ (\u03bb+\u00b5)\u2207(divu).\nProof.\ndiv\u03c3= (div\u03c31,\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7,div\u03c3n),where\u03c3k= (\u03c31k,\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7,\u03c3nk)T.\nLet us compute\n(div 2\u2207(s)u)k=n\u2211\ni=1\u2202i(\u2202iuk+\u2202kui) = \u2206uk+\u2202k(divu).\nNote that div(divu)I=\u2207(divu). The desired result then follows. \u25a1\nThe divergence of the stress tensor for incompressible \ufb02ow can be simpli\ufb01ed to the\nLaplacian of the velocity since divu= 0.

The tangential\nboundary condition of ucan be imposed weakly in the equation w=\u2207\u00d7u.\n\npage_label: 8\nfile_path: test\\regression\\regression_test004\\NavierStokesPDE.pdf\n\n8 LONG CHEN\nFlow with the same Reynolds number (in domains with the same shape) will be similar.\nTherefore one can construct an experiment using practical size in lab to model \ufb02ow in large\nscales. AsReincreases, the equation becomes inviscid. From the de\ufb01nition of Re, for\nlarge scale problem ( LorUbig), the viscosity is tiny. In the limiting case, Re=\u221e,\u00b5= 0,\nNavier-Stokes equation becomes the so-called Euler equation. The \ufb02uid is called ideal\n\ufb02uid. Note that N-S equation is second order while Euler is \ufb01rst order. The boundary\nconditionsu= 0should be changed accordingly to u\u00b7n= 0. If there is a mismatch in the\nboundary condition, it cause problems near the boundary, known as boundary layer effect;\nsee [1] for details.\nThere are mainly three dif\ufb01culties associated to the Navier-Stokes equations:\n(1) First it is time dependent. Stability in time could be an issue for both PDE and\nnumerical methods. For example, we still do not know wether solutions to N-S\nequation will below up in \ufb01nite time or not (for a reasonable large class of initial\nconditions).\n(2) Second, it is nonlinear. Ef\ufb01cient numerical methods can be developed for this\nspecial quadratic nonlinearity. But the convection u\u00b7\u2207derivative, especially when\nit is dominate ( \u00b5\u226a1), will cause a serious trouble in the numerical computation.\n(3) Third it is a coupled system of (u,p). The pressure pcan be eliminate if we\nconsideruin the exactly divergence free space. But the divergence free condition\nis hardly to impose in numerical methods.\nWe shall solve this tangle by focusing on one dif\ufb01culty at a time. We \ufb01rst skip the time\nderivative and nonlinearity to get the steady-state Stokes equations\n\u2212\u00b5\u2206u+\u2207p=f, (13)\ndivu= 0. (14)\nand will study Stokes equations in detail in the next Chapter.\n1.5. Different formulations.\n1.5.1. Lagrangian formulation. We use material derivative to write the equations as\n\u03c1D\u03c4u+\u2207p=\u03c1f,\nD\u03c4\u03c1= 0,\ndivu= 0.\nThis formulation is useful for numerical methods based on Lagrangian coordinate includ-\ning semi-Lagrangian method and characteristic method.\n1.5.2. Vorticity-Velocity-Pressure formulation. We introduce the vorticity w=\u2207\u00d7u\nwhich is a vector function in three dimensions and a scalar function in two dimensions.\nFor a two dimensional velocity u= (u1,u2), the\u2207\u00d7 is applied to (u1,u2,0)and only\nnonzero component is kept, i.e., \u2207\u00d7u=\u22021u2\u2212\u22022u1.\nUsing the identity\n(15) (u\u00b7\u2207)u= (curlu)\u00d7u+1\n2\u2207(|u|2)\nwe can obtain the rotation form of the Navier-Stokes equations:\n\u2212\u00b5\u2206u+\u2202tu+w\u00d7u+\u2207P=f,\ndivu= 0,w=\u2207\u00d7u.\n---------------------\nGiven the context information and not prior knowledge, answer the query.\nQuery: What is the equation for the convection-diffusion equation in the vorticity-stream function formulation?\nAnswer: "}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The convection-diffusion equation in the vorticity-stream function formulation is \u2202tw+ (\u2207\u00d7\u03c8)\u00b7\u2207w\u2212\u00b5\u2206w=\u2207\u00d7f."}]}
