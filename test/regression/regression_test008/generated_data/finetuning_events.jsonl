A number in scientific notation is written as a*10^n, where a is any real number and n is an integer. To convert a number from scientific notation to a regular number without exponents, you need to look at the power of ten. If the power is positive, you move the decimal point to the right, and if it's negative, you move it to the left. The power tells you how many places to move the decimal point. Conversely, to change a number to scientific notation, you move the decimal point so it is to the right of the first nonzero digit. If the decimal point is moved n places to the left and this makes the number smaller, n is positive; otherwise, n is negative. If the decimal point is not moved, n is 0.\nNew Answer: "}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Scientific notation is a technique utilized to represent extremely large or small numbers. It's expressed as a*10^n, where 'a' can be any real number and 'n' is an integer. To transform a number from scientific notation to a regular number without exponents, the power of ten is examined. If the power is positive, the decimal point is shifted to the right, and if it's negative, it's moved to the left. The power indicates the number of places the decimal point should be moved. On the other hand, to convert a number to scientific notation, the decimal point is relocated so it's to the right of the first non-zero digit. If moving the decimal point n places to the left makes the number smaller, then n is positive; if not, n is negative. If the decimal point isn't moved at all, n is 0."}]}

An example of a rate is a car that travels 110 miles in 2 hours, which can be expressed as 110 miles/2 hours or 55 miles per hour. On the other hand, a ratio is a comparison of two quantities with the same units. For instance, in a class with 23 students and 1 teacher, the student-teacher ratio is 23:1.\nNew Answer: "}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "A rate is a comparison of two different quantities that have different units. For instance, if a car travels 110 miles in 2 hours, this can be expressed as a rate of 110 miles/2 hours or 55 miles per hour. Conversely, a ratio is a comparison of two quantities that share the same units. An example of this would be a class that has 23 students and 1 teacher, where the student-teacher ratio would be 23:1."}]}

For example, if you add 5 and -5, the result is 0.\n\nThe Commutative Property states that the order in which you add numbers does not change the sum. For example, 3 + 4 equals 7, and if you switch the order to 4 + 3, the result is still 7.\n\nThe Associative Property states that when you add three or more numbers, the way in which the numbers are grouped does not change the sum. For example, (2 + 3) + 4 equals 9, and if you change the grouping to 2 + (3 + 4), the result is still 9.\nNew Answer: "}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The properties of addition include the Inverse Property, the Commutative Property, and the Associative Property. \n\nThe Inverse Property states that when you add a number to its inverse, the result is zero.

A number in scientific notation is written as a * 10^n, where a is a number and n is an integer. To convert a number from scientific notation to a standard number without exponents, you look at the power of ten (n). If n is positive, you move the decimal point to the right. If n is negative, you move the decimal point to the left. The value of n tells you how many places to move the decimal point. \n\nTo convert a standard number to scientific notation, you move the decimal point so it is to the right of the first nonzero digit. If the decimal point is moved n places to the left and this makes the number smaller, n is positive; otherwise, n is negative. If the decimal point is not moved, n is 0.\nNew Answer: "}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Scientific notation is a technique utilized to represent extremely large or extremely small numbers.

A number in this form is written as\n, where and n is an integer.

If that number ispositive, move the decimal point to the right. If it is negative,move the decimal point to the left. The number tells you howmany places to move the decimal point.\nFor example,\n.\nTo change a number to scientific notation, move the deci-\nmal point so it is to the right of the first nonzero digit. If thedecimal point is moved n places to the left and this makes\nthe number smaller, nis positive; otherwise, nis negative. If\nthe decimal point is not moved, nis 0.\nFor example, . 0.0000216 =2.16 *10\n-53.97 *103=3970-1.2*10-43.62 *1051\u2026 \u0192 a \u0192 610 a*10n I=13800210.0552152 =1045 t=5 years  r=5.5% =0.055  p=$3800 t=time periodr=percentage rate of interestp=principalI=interest 1dollar amount2I=p#r#t*Decimal Numbers\nThe numbers after the decimal point represent fractions withdenominators that are powers of 10.

If it isn't, shift the decimal point to the right, effectively multiplying by 10, 100, or a similar factor, until it becomes a whole number.
