The image provided appears to be a page from an educational document or textbook explaining the concepts of accuracy and precision, particularly in the context of scientific measurement. It features text and three dartboard illustrations, each visually representing a different scenario to further clarify accuracy and precision. 

1. The first dartboard on the left is labeled "Inaccurate and Imprecise." It shows darts scattered mainly to one side of the center an, indicating that both accuracy and precision are not achieved since the target of the board (bullseye) is not hit and the darts are neither consistently hitting the same spot.

2. The second dartboard in the middle, labeled "Inaccurate but Precise," displays darts closely grouped together but off-center. This represents a state of precision where the darts are consistently hitting the same incorrect area (repeatability) but not hitting the intended target, reflecting the absence of accuracy.

3. The third dartboard on the right, labeled "Accurate and Precise," shows a cluster of darts in the center of the board. This demonstrates both accuracy as the darts hit the target and precision as they are consistently grouped in the same area.

The images are used as metaphors to grasp that precision pertains to the repeatability or consistency of results, while accuracy indicates how close the results are to the true value. The text around these images further elaborates these concepts and their difference. The importance of calibrating equipment to attain accurate and precise measurements is also highlighted in the text. 

Significantly, the text introduces the concept of 'significant figures' in scientific measurement and explains their definitions, stressing that understanding these concepts contribute to proper scientific inquiry and the importance of being accurate (hitting the target) and precise (consistency between results).
