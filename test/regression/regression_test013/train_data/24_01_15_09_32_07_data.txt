The image depicts a section of a textbook or educational material discussing the concepts of accuracy and precision in the context of scientific measurements. This segment includes an illustration (Figure 1.11), featuring three dartboards, each symbolizing a different situation of accuracy and precision.

1. The first dartboard on the left exhibits a scenario of "Inaccurate and Imprecise," where the darts are dispersed across the board, not adhering to the bullseye or any particular pattern.
2. The middle dartboard illustrates an "Inaccurate but Precise" condition, demonstrating the darts are consistently grouped near each other but miss the bullseye.
3. The final dartboard on the right portrays an "Accurate and Precise" situation, where the darts are centered on the bullseye and closely grouped.

The educational text accompanying these dartboards explains the difference between accuracy and precision, emphasizing that they are distinct from each other. Accuracy denotes how close measured values align to the true value or target (the bullseye in the dartboard analogy), while precision refers to the closeness of the measured values to each other.

Further, the diagram is captioned "Figure 1.11: Difference Between Accuracy and Precision," using the dartboards as a metaphor to communicate these concepts effectively in a lab setting or within a scientific experiment. The segment further touches on the significance of dart players (or scientists) aspiring for both accuracy and precision in their throws (or measurements).

Following the dartboard visuals, the text introduces the topic of significant figures with a section heading "Significant Figures." It explains that scientific measurements can never be 100% accurate due to the inherent inaccuracy of measurement instruments. Therefore, the use of significant figures becomes essential to quantify the accuracy of these measurements while also highlighting that understanding both accuracy and precision remains critical in scientific experiments.
