The relationship between the fracture point, ultimate stress, and ductility varies. For materials with low ductility, such as brittle materials, the fracture point is very close to, if not identical to, the ultimate stress. This is the greatest stress that the material can experience. On the other hand, for materials with high ductility, like ductile materials, the fracture point is further from the ultimate stress. These materials can experience significant elongation or \"necking\" before failure and may have a long period in the plastic region before reaching the fracture point."}]}

In the elastic region, an applied stress will cause a strain that is non-permanent. When the stress is removed, the material will return to its original state, reducing any elongation to zero. This is the energy absorbed and released during this process. \n\nIn the plastic region, applied stresses cause irreversible strains.

The strain energy in this case is not fully recoverable as the material has undergone permanent deformation. \n\nThe yield strength is the dividing point between elastic behavior and plastic behavior, often referred to as the \"point of no return\".
